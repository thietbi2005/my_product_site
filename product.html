<h1>HST-ZXQ3 Automatic Metallographic Specimen Mounting Press</h1><div><p> The HST-ZXQ3Amounting machine is used to mount Metallographic and petrographic samples that are tiny, difficult to hold or irregular before grinding and polishing.                                  </p><p> - After being mounted in this machine, it is convenient to grind and polish the sample, which is helpful for viewing the material structure of the sample under a metallographic Microscope; and Testing the hardness of the sample on a Hardness Tester. </p><p> - The inlay material of this machine is limited to thermoset materials. The pressing temperature of different thermoset materials can be adjusted and customized according to the material. </p><p> - This machine can automatically heat and pressurize. After pressing and forming, it will cool down and stop automatically. Open the upper cover and press the up button. The sample will automatically rise and you can take out the parts. </p><p> - This machine is a multifunctional water-cooled inlay machine for inlaying various samples. It has the advantages of large number of molds and short mold making time. </p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p> HST-ZXQ3 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> The Sample Diameter </p></td><td><p> φ25mm, φ30mm，φ40mm(choose one,Two samples at a time ) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Heater </p></td><td><p> 1650W </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Input voltage </p></td><td><p> 220V  50HZ </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Heating temperature range </p></td><td><p> 35~200 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Cooling method </p></td><td><p> Water cooling </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Dimension </p></td><td><p> 395*460*560mm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Package Size </p></td><td><p> 610*495*670mm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Net Weight </p></td><td><p> 50kg </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Gross Weight </p></td><td><p> 64kg </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
