<h1>MMW-1 Universal Abrasion Tester</h1><div><p> MMW-1 Universal Abrasion Tester Application   The tile abrasion Testing machine can simulate rolling, sliding and rolling &amp; sliding combined movement under the certain contact pressure to complete point, line and plane simulating tests. It can be used to evaluate the friction and wear performance of lubricant, metal, plastics, coating, rubber, ceramics etc. It can not only content with the needs of traditional petrochemical industry to research, develop and inspect the various kinds of intermediate &amp; high grade hydraulic oil, combustion engine oil and gear oil.  Also it can be tested under dry condition, but also the needs of simulating evaluation to new material development and new technology research.   Standards   ASTM D-2266, D-3702, D-4172   Features   The tile abrasion testing machine adopts process control principle, and combines industrial control computer with the configuration software technology and internet technology; Apply incorporate structure design, integrate embedded industry computer, configuration software,  acquisition module and executor as a whole to control the test process, all test operation can be completed at the main interface of the computer; It features flexible configuration control mode, multiple friction couplings, wide speed adjusting range, simulating high temperature circumstances, high automation and easy to use.   Specifications   <table><tbody><tr><td> NO.</td><td> Item</td><td> Specification</td></tr><tr><td> 1</td><td> Load range</td><td> 10~1000N(stepless)</td></tr><tr><td> 2</td><td> Relative error of load indicating value</td><td> ±1%</td></tr><tr><td> 3</td><td> Friction torque measuring range</td><td> 2.5N.m</td></tr><tr><td> 4</td><td> Rotate speed range of spindle</td><td> 1~2000r/min,  linear velocity up to over 4 m/s.</td></tr><tr><td> 5</td><td> Temperature control range</td><td> Room temperature~200°C</td></tr><tr><td> 6</td><td> Time control range</td><td> 10s~9999min</td></tr><tr><td> 7</td><td> Computer &amp; data processing range</td><td> Apply industrial control computer and configuration software to control the machine and test process, display different parameters in real time, record friction-time curve and temperature-time curve automatically.
