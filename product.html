<h1>HST-L800 Integrated floor thickness gauge</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p>: HST-L800 Integrated floor thickness gauge is a portable and non-destructive Testing instrument for measuring the thickness of concrete or other non-ferromagnetic media. When used, the transmitter and receiver probes are placed on the two relative testing surfaces of the concrete, respectively, to transmit and receive electromagnetic signals, and the instrument is connected according to the connection. The received signal strength is used to measure the concrete thickness. <h3> Technique Specification: </h3><table><tbody><tr>Test-range" style="box-sizing:border-box;"&gt; <th> Thickness test range </th><td><p> 20~ 850mm </p></td></tr><tr><th> Test Accuracy </th><td><p> 20~350mm ±1 ，351~600mm ±2 ，601~850mm ±4 </p></td></tr><tr><th> Data storage capacity </th><td><p> 950 Components* 1000 Measuring Points </p></td></tr><tr><th> Host parameters </th><td><p> Screen size: 2.8 inch LCD </p></td></tr><tr><th> Power supply </th><td><p> Both host and transmitter probes are built-in lithium batteries </p></td></tr><tr><th> Working environment requirements </th><td><p> Temperature: -10 ~40℃ Humidity: &lt;90% RH，Non-strong alternating electromagnetic field，No long direct sunshine </p></td></tr></tbody></table></p></div>
