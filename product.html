<h1>Hydraulic wafer sample punching machine</h1><div><p> Introduction: Hydraulic wafer sample punching machine is specially developed by our company. It is used for the production of Ф50 wafer samples for steel mill sheets. It is suitable for steel plate samples with thickness of 0.2mm-3mm and strength of 200MPa-1000MPa. The sample preparation machine is hydraulically loaded, and the steel plate is grasped by both hands, and the foot switch is punched. The equipment is safe and reliable, easy to operate, high in work efficiency, beautiful in appearance and strong in applicability. <p> Main technical parameters </p><p> Specimen specifications: steel plates with a thickness of 0.2 mm - 3 mm, a strength of 200 MPa - 1000 MPa, and a width of 120 mm; </p><p> Punching maximum load: 1000kN; </p><p> Operating rate: 6 seconds / time; </p><p> Punching punch: Ф50; </p><p> Sample preparation error: ≤0.05mm; </p><p> Die life: 10,000 times; </p><p> Loading method: hydraulic type; </p><p> Protective device: It has a safety protection device for preventing finger insertion, and has an emergency brake switch; </p><p> Power supply: AC380V, 3 phase, 50HZ, 5Kw. </p></p></div>
