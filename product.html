<h1>yellowing resistance aging test  chamber</h1><div><p><p> Main feature: </p> Aging:This machine is to promote the deterioration of vulcanite, and then to calculate the change rate of tensile and elongation.    But also the role of ultraviolet radiation to simulate sun and heat, the specimen in the machine in the desks by ultraviolet radiation and temperature effects, over time, observed the extent of the sample resistance to yellowing, discoloration of gray scale can be used as a reference, to determine its yellowing level.    Product in the course of radiation or by sunlight during transport, the impact of the container environment change in color caused by the occurrence ofthe defective product in this machine using the UV lamp 300W,so that experiments can be completed in a shorter time,this machine can be used as the basic resistance to yellowing Test, also when the aging Test machine and oven use,showing a multi-function machine This machine is equipped with forced hot air circulation control system to ensure uniformtemperature distribution. Anti- yellow: This machine simulate atmospheric environment which driven by the sun ultraviolet radiation,Generally consider being tested 9H in the 50 degree is theoretically equal to 6 months exposed at the outside atmosphere. Corresponding standard: CNS-3556,JIS-K6301,ASTM-D2436,ASTM D1148 Applicable industries: Aging anti-yellow Testing chamber is widely used in paint, resins, plastics, printing and packaging, <p> aluminum, adhesives, auto,cosmetics, metals, electronics, electroplating, medicine, etc.. </p><p> Techincal parameter: </p><table><tbody><tr><td> Model </td><td> Aging anti-yellow testing chamber </td></tr><tr><td> Inside size </td><td> 50×60×50cm </td></tr><tr><td> Volume </td><td> 91×55×100cm </td></tr><tr><td> Temperature range </td><td> RT~200 celsius </td></tr><tr><td> Temperature resolution </td><td> 0.1 celsius </td></tr><tr><td> Accuracy </td><td> ±1 celsius </td></tr><tr><td> Timer </td><td> 0-999H,digital display,memory-type with buzzer </td></tr><tr><td> Control mode </td><td> Automatic calculation controller </td></tr><tr><td> Wheel speed </td><td> Dia. 45cm 10R.P.M. ±2R.P.M </td></tr><tr><td> UV lamp </td><td> UV300W </td></tr><tr><td> Heating </td><td> hot loop </td></tr><tr><td> Protection </td><td> EGO over-temperature guiding light,overload switch ammeter </td></tr><tr><td> Material </td><td> inside SUS#304 stainless steel,outside high-level paint </td></tr><tr><td> Weight </td><td> 87kg </td></tr><tr><td> Power </td><td> AC220V,19.5AC </td></tr></tbody></table></p></div>
