<h1>HST-XJB-200 Polishing and Etching Instrument</h1><div><p> Introduction: Model HST-XJB-200 Metallographic inspecting instrument can be used for metallographic inspection and failure analysis of various large size work pieces in field. XJB-200 does not need to cut the work piece to take sample, it can grind and polish the work piece directly and thus it can keep the completeness of work piece. It is an idea instrument to be used in the manufacturing fields of aviation, machinery, automobile, production and inspection of boiler &amp; pressure vessels, petrochemical industry, railway and shipbuilding industry, electric power plant and station, as well as the industries of safety inspection, quality supervision, physical and chemical tests etc. Main features: This instrument has combined complete set of in-field sample preparation, microscopic observation and digital microphotography together, the operation is quick and easy. The Microscope adopts wild-field eyepiece and plano-achromatic objective, it has focus micro-adjusting mechanism, the focus is stable and the image is clear. It adopts halogen lamp as light source, the brightness is adjustable, the view field is even and flat. </p></div>
