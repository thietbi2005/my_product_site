<h1>WLN-5 Medical Bone Screw Axial Tension And Torsion Testing Machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> Mainly used to Test the torsion strength of medical bone nails, insert torsion and remove torsion, axial tensile strength and self-tapping performance Testing. Simple multi-axis testing is often necessary to test the performance of a variety of devices such as pharmaceutical and surgical products, electronic components, and packaging. Across all industries, the development of new products and materials demands stringent standard-based and functional testing with a need for increased breadth of capability in testing equipment. For example, some of these standards, such as such as ISO 80369 for lure connectors, requires that the test is performed with both axial and torsion control. 2.
