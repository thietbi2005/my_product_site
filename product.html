<h1>HST-HV5/10/30/50Z Auto-Turret vicker Hardness Tester</h1><div><p> Instruction: Hardness Tester is used to determine the hardness of materials, and Hardness Test is a means to judge the  quality of metal materials or parts of products. The so-called hardness is the ability of a material to resist the indentation of another body without residual deformation under certain conditions. The greater the resistance, the higher the hardness, and vice versa, Specifications: Model:HST-HV5/10/30/50Z Display model:Small LCD digital display Turret Type:Automatic Test force:0.3Kgf(2.91N),0.5Kgf(4.9N),1Kgf(9.8N),2Kgf(19.6N),3Kgf(29.4N) 5Kgf(49.0N) Hardness measuring range:8~2900HV RS232,Built-in print, data:NO Power Supply:AC220V±5% ，50~60Hz </p></div>
