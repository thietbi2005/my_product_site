<h1>TIME®5430 Digital Shore A Hardness Tester</h1><div><p><p> Shore A Hardness Tester TIME®5430 is the first new generation digital durometer developed by Beijing TIME High Technology Ltd. It has the same outlook with the old durometer TIME5420 but totally different inner design. TIME®5430 adopts new LVDT displacement sensor and OLED screen. It is also added with USB interface and software. This Shore Hardness Tester is suitable for measuring soft rubber, plastic, printer roller and other elastomers. </p> - It adopts LVDT displacement sensor, which is accurate and can work in harsh environment -The OLED screen clearly shows the hardness value. Menu operation. -Automatic Zero point calibration. -Three work modes to meet varied Testing requirements: real-time, peak-value-lock and timing-lock. -In peak-value-lock mode, the instrument can automatically lock the peak hardness value. -In timing-lock mode, set the timing from 1 to 60 seconds. It automatically starts timing and locks the measured value. <p> -In the lock modes, the upper and lower limits of the measured value can be preset, and a prompt is displayed when out of the limit,which is convenient for batch detection. It can also calculate the average value and automatically removing gross errors. </p></p></div>
