<h1>HSTC-200C Vertical Flammability Testing Machine</h1><div><p> Introduction: The intelligent vertical combustion tester is designed and manufactured according to the requirements of IEC60950-1, UL94, IEC60707, IEC60695-2-2, GB5169, ISO1210 and other standards. It is to measure the degree of damage of the sample as well as the linear burning rate and afterflame/afterglow time of the sample. Used to conduct horizontal and vertical flammability Tests on rubber or plastic material parts of electrical equipment and appliances. The product box shell is spray-coated iron plate and equipped with a transparent observation window. The combustion, afterflame and afterburning time are integrated into the touch screen display. The device has beautiful appearance, easy use and reliable performance. Test products include: flame retardant performance tests on plastic parts on wires and cables, electrical appliances, and electrical products, engineering plastics, and rubber materials. Parameters: </p><p> 1.Control method: Taiwan Weilun touch screen (7-inch color screen) + PLC; 2. Operation type: electronic remote control; 3.
