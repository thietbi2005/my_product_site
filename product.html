<h1>Computer Controlled Bolt nut Torsion Testing Machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> The Testing machine mainly detects the axial force and torque (or torque coefficient) of the high strength bolt connection pair (M16-M39) with large hexagonal head. The equipment is automatically loaded by cycloid needle wheel reducer, imported linear guideway, all Chinese operating interface, microcomputer controlled automatic tightening, relaxation, reset, intelligent prompt in operation process, convenient and fast operation. When the axial force reaches the standard setting value, the detector will automatically record the Test data, automatically calculate the average axial force, average torque coefficient, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the sample by computer, and can display the output torque coefficient, axial force curve, torque curve and so on. At the same time, the detector will have the functions of parameter setting, calibration, data report printing and output. 2.
