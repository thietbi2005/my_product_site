<h1>YYF-50 Slow Strain Rate Stress Corrosion Testing Machine</h1><div><p> 1. Equipment overview 1.1 Name, model and specification Name: Slow strain rate Stress Corrosion Testing machine Model: YYF-50 Specification: Maximum load 50kN 1.2 Overview of functions Slow strain rate (SSRT) stress corrosion (SCC) Testing machine is used to conduct corrosion tensile Tests on materials in corrosive environments, mainly to study the stress corrosion sensitivity of metal materials in corrosive solutions. The host structure is in the form of a frame, and the loading unit is flexibly installed at the upper or lower end according to the test requirements to adapt to the test requirements of different media environments. The environmental medium is a solution medium under low temperature and normal pressure. The experimental kettle is generally made of high borosilicate glass, which not only reduces the equipment cost, but also ensures the corrosion resistance to general media. 2. Test machine assembly The test system consists of the test host (including host frame, loading system, corrosive environment container (test kettle), test fixture), control cabinet (Contains computer and measurement and control system), test software and other parts. </p></div>
