<h1>Compression Elastic Modulus Test  for concrete</h1><div><h3> Application: </h3><p> Determination of Static Compression Elastic modulus on concrete requires a Compression Testing machine of controlling pace rate precision 1 grade. This Test FRAME adopts both dial gauge and displacement sensor. While the TEST FRAME measuring accuracy should be better than 0.001mm. </p><p> This TEST FRAME is a working stand which quality is very important to ensures the measuring data. </p><p> This TEST FRAME suitable for concrete specimen of prism, cube or cylinder with a gauge length 150mm. Easy and quick application to the specimen. </p><p> Technical Parameters </p><ul><li> Gauge length: 150mm </li><li> Specimen range: prism, cube or cylinder </li><li> Dial gauge or inductive sensor are NOT included in the standard configure. </li></ul></div>
