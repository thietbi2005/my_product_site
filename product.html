<h1>HST-M2 Metallographic Pre-grinding Machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> And Feature: HST-M2 Metallographic Specimen Pre-grinding Machine is a kind of double disk pre-grinding machine. Taking advantage of various water-resistant sand papers with different granularity. It can be used to pre-grind various metal and alloy materials. By using this machine, manual grinding can be replaced by mechanical grinding so as to improve specimen preparing efficiency, also the deforming and heating traces produced during cutting can be removed completely. This will be suitable to observe and measure the metallographic structure of specimen under microscope. 2.Technical Parameters: Model: HST-M2 Grinding Polishing Disc, Diameter: 203 mm Grinding Polishing Disc, Revolving Speed: 450 rpm Input Voltage: Single Phase, AC220V, 50Hz Dimension: 710×680×330 mm Weight: 45.00 KG </p></div>
