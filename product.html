<h1>HST-ZXQ2T Automatic Metallographic Specimen Mounting Press</h1><div><p> Introduction: For Metallographic rock phase sample analysis, mosaic is the first step in the sample preparation process, especially for some difficult holding tiny samples, irregularly shaped samples, or the need for automatic grinding and polishing samples, the mosaic is an important step before sample preparation. HST-ZXQ2T automatic metallographic sample mounting press is an advanced automatic sample mosaic equipment, controlling the whole mosaic process by program, one-touch operation of heating, pressurization, loading, cooling, unloading process. Main parameters: MODEL :HST-ZXQ2T Sample diameter :Ø22×15mm; Ø30×15mm Ø45×15mm  (Choose one) Heating temperature :35-200℃ Heating time :0~99 min 99s Cooling time ：0~99 min 99s Cooling method :Water Heater ：220V, 700W Machine power ：950W Power supply ：Single phase AC 220V, 50Hz Dimension ：455× 475× 430 (mm) Net weight ：50kg Gross weight ：62kg </p></div>
