<h1>Tensile Sample Edging Machine</h1><div><p> 1. Product Introduction: HGLM series of tensile specimen edging machine is strictly in accordance with the requirements of GB/T 　228.1-2010 "Metal material tensile Test room temperature test method", it is to remove the work hardened zone of the tensile specimen due to shear or stamping The equipment can also polish the burrs of samples processed by other equipment. The equipment is based on the grinding length of the tensile sample LC and the radius of the support roller set by the transition arc radius (not less than 20mm), and the grinding The shape of the sample is completely consistent to ensure the processing accuracy of the sample, and it is better to use with the punch. 2.Features: 2.1. Grinding the hardened area produced during the punching process of the tensile specimen of the plate; 2.2 The grinding platform matches the shape of the sample to ensure that the tolerance of the parallel and arc parts of the sample meet the standard; 2.3 The feed can be adjusted **, the feed accuracy is 0.05mm; 2.4 The shape tolerance of the sample after grinding does not exceed 0.06mm; 2.5 The roughness of the grinding surface of the sample Ra≤0.4; 3. Technical Parameters: Product model HGLM-50 HGLM-80 HGLM-100 Proportion sample HGLM-Z Like shape dumbbell shape straight Sample gauge length Lo50 Lo80 　Lo100 5.65 or 11.3 Sample application Extending flexing Clamping thickness ≤15mm Working power 380V/50HZ Equipment weight 300kg Overall dimensions 900×500×1000 (mm) </p></div>
