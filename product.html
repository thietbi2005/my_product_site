<h1>XHRS-150 Digital Plastics Rockwell Hardness Tester</h1><div><p> 1. XHRS-150 Digital Plastics Rockwell Hardness Tester is adopted a mechanism to load and unload the Test force automatically, through rotating the Load-Change Hand Wheel to change test force; therefore the operation of this instrument is very simply; easy and prompt. Besides setting zero to the dial, there is no man-made operation error. The present Hardness Tester is with high sensitivity and stability, so as to suitable for usage in workshop and Testing laboratory. 2. The method of plastics Rockwell Hardness Test is to press a ball indenter of a certain diameter into a specimen to be tested firstly with initial test force P0 and than together with main test force P1. After apply with total test force P (P0 + P1) and keep a stipulated duration time, than unload the main test force. The difference e between the press-in depth h1 during the initial test force keeping and the press-in depth h0 made by the initial test force applied means the permanent increment of indentation depth. Each press-in depth 0.002mm is as one hardness unit of plastics Rockwell. This test method is with the characteristic of high speed to test hardness and it is widely applied in inspecting the hardness for specimens. Technical specifications 1.
