<h1>A14.404-AW Computerized Research Grade Metallurgical Microscope</h1><div><p> The A14.404-AW computerized research-grade Metallographic microscope is a trinocular inverted metallographic Microscope with a newly designed infinity optical system. It can be widely used in casting, smelting, heat treatment research, raw material inspection or material processing analysis Inverted microscope. The machine comprehensively covers various observation methods such as bright field, dark field, simple polarized light, differential interference, etc., and adapts to various research needs. </p><p> l </p><p> In order to meet the long-term observation needs of users, the FX-41MW uses a low-hand position operation mode and is equipped with a 360 ° rotating binocular observation tube, which fully conforms to the ergonomic observation mode. </p><p> l </p><p> The FX-41MW body is made of all-metal casting, the surface is treated with anti-corrosion and wear-resistant technology, and the quality is guaranteed and solid. Make full use of the built-in space of the fuselage, place the instrument disassembly tool, which is generally used to disassemble the main parts of the instrument, pragmatism, convenient storage. </p><p> l </p><p> The front objective magnification display function, through the built-in magnification sensor, displays the current magnification in front of the instrument, making the research work more convenient. </p><p> l </p><p> The ECO infrared sensor system with the concept of environmental protection and economy is added. When the microscope has not been operated for a long time, the system will automatically turn off the power or turn it on again to save energy. </p><p> 2. </p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Item </p></td><td></td><td><p> A14.404-AW </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Optical system </p></td><td><p> Infinite chromatic aberration correction optical system </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Observation tube </p></td><td><p> Trinocular observation tube, tilted at 45 °, hinge set can rotate 360 °, fixed eyepiece tube, pupil distance adjustment range 50-75mm, two-stage split ratio: binocular: trinocular = 100: 0 or 0: 100 </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Eyepiece </p></td><td><p> High eye point wide field plan eyepiece PL10X / 22mm, adjustable diopter. </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> High eye point wide field plan eyepiece PL10X / 22mm, adjustable diopter, with micrometer </p></td><td><p> O </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> High eye point wide field plan eyepiece PL15X / 16mm, adjustable diopter </p></td><td><p> O </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Objective lens </p></td><td><p> Infinity long distance bright and dark field objective lens：LMPL5X /0.15BD DIC  WD9.0 </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Infinity long distance bright and dark field objective lens：LMPL10X/0.30BD DIC  WD9.0 </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Infinity long distance bright and dark field objective lens：LMPL20X/0.45BD DIC   WD3.4 </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Infinity long distance light and dark semi-apochromatic objective lens：LMPLFL50X/0.55 BD   WD7.5 </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Infinity long distance light and dark semi-apochromatic objective lens : LMPLFL100X/0.80 BD   WD2.1 </p></td><td><p> O </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Converter </p></td><td><p> Internal positioning 5 hole bright and dark field converter (with DIC slot), built-in magnification sensor </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Frame </p></td><td><p> Reflective bright and dark field gold camera frame, using low-hand position coarse and fine adjustment coaxial, coarse adjustment stroke 9mm, focal plane upward 6.5mm, downward 2.5mm, fine adjustment accuracy 0.002mm, with elastic adjustment handwheel to prevent sliding </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> With bright and dark field switching device, with variable field diaphragm and aperture diaphragm, the center is adjustable; with color filter slot and polarizer slot, with light source brightness indicator bar, with infrared sensor and objective magnification display </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Stage </p></td><td><p> Three-layer mechanical mobile platform, platform size: 240 (W) × 250 (L), moving range 50 × 50mm, bidirectional line rail transmission, right-hand low-hand position control </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Lighting system </p></td><td><p> Use external wide voltage transformer, input 100-240V, output 15V13.4A, 12V100W halogen lamp, brightness is continuously adjustable </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Polarized accessories </p></td><td><p> Polarizer insert, fixed analyzer insert, 360 ° rotating analyzer insert </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Color filter </p></td><td><p> LBD Color filter </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Differential interference </p></td><td><p> DIC Differential interference components </p></td><td><p> O </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Metallographic analysis system </p></td><td><p> FMIA2020 Genuine metallographic analysis software, Sony chip 5 million camera, 0.5X adapter mirror interface, micrometer. </p></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Computer </p></td><td><p> HP </p></td><td><p> O </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> is standard configuration; “O” is optional </p></div>
