<h1>HST-PB10 Paper Cardboard Determination Bending Stiffness Tester</h1><div><p> The microcomputer controlled stiffness tester is an intelligent computerized stiffness Tester, which is suitable for measuring the bending stiffness of paper, cardboard and other strong sheet-like non-metallic materials with a thickness of less than 2mm. The main technical parameters of the instrument conform to the relevant regulations of ISO2493 "Determination of Stiffness of Paper and Cardboard" and GB/T2679·3 "Determination of Stiffness of Paperboard". </p><p> The angle can be arbitrarily set between (1 and 90) °, and the Test time is arbitrarily set within a predetermined range (3 s to 35 s). With automatic zero test function, it is the first fully automatic stiffness tester for the 5.7in liquid crystal display curve in China. The real-time display stiffness and time curve are simple and convenient to operate. The instrument has the functions of test, display, memory, statistics and printing of various parameters included in the standard, and provides scientific data analysis for the detection of bending stiffness of cardboard. </p><p> 01 Measuring range: (15~10000) MN. </p><p> 02 Accuracy: ±0.6mN below 50mN, the remaining ±1% </p><p> 03 Resolution: 0.1mN </p><p> 04 Indication variability: ≤1% </p><p> 05 Bending length: (50/25/20/15/10/5) ±0.1mm </p><p> 06 Bending angle: (±7.5 degrees or ±15 degrees) ±0.3 degrees (1~90 degrees adjustable) </p><p> 07 Load arm length: 200 ° ± 20 ° / min </p><p> 08 Printout: Modular integrated thermal printer </p><p> 09 Data display: 5.7in LCD display with curve display </p><p> 10 Printout: Modular integrated thermal printer </p><p> 11 Working environment: temperature (20 ± 10) ° C, humidity &lt;85% </p><p> 12 Dimensions: 340mm (length) × 330mm (width) × 340mm (height) </p><p> 13 Instrument weight: about 35kG </p></div>
