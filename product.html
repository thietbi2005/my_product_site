<h1>HST-PA Steel Strand Anchor Connector Fatigue Testing Machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> steel strand anchor connector fatigue Test machine is based on "GB / T14370-2007 prestressed tendon anchors, fixtures and connectors", "JT / T 329.2-1997 highway bridge prestressed steel strand Test methods and inspection rules for anchors and connectors "," Technical conditions for anchors, clamps and connectors for prestressed tendons of railway engineering TB / T 3193-2008 "," Technical regulations for anchors for prestressed tendons of JGJ85-2002 ", etc. The requirements of the standard, the newly developed steel strand anchor and connector pulsation fatigue Testing machine, the system is suitable for the fatigue life of steel strand for prestressed concrete, anchors for prestressed tendons, clamps and connectors, etc. The cyclic load performance test is a fatigue life test and Testing device with a wide range of applications, reliable performance, and low operating cost in the field of fatigue performance testing in buildings, highways, railways, bridges and other fields. Mainly include PMW series pulsator host, PMCS full digital measurement and control system, 2 sets (250/500/1000/2000/2500 / 3000kN selected according to test ability) actuators, 1 set of loading frame (load capacity and selected operation) Actuators), tooling, computer data acquisition and processing system, etc. It is used to test the dynamic load fatigue performance of steel stranded anchor connectors, concrete members, etc., and can complete 35 holes at a time. <table><tbody><tr><td> Technical parameter </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Maximum working pressure of the system </td><td> 19 / 38MPa </td></tr><tr><td> Maximum static test force of the system </td><td> 250/500/1000/2000/2500/3000/4000 / 5000kN × 2 </td></tr><tr><td> Maximum dynamic test force of the system </td><td> 250/500/1000/2000/2500/3000/4000 / 5000kN × 2 </td></tr><tr><td> System load indication accuracy </td><td> ≤ ± 1% </td></tr><tr><td> 1000kN actuator main technical parameters </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Maximum static test force </td><td> 1000kN </td></tr><tr><td> Accuracy: </td><td> 20% FS from each point ± 1% </td></tr><tr><td> Maximum dynamic test force </td><td> 1000kN </td></tr><tr><td> The dynamic indication fluctuation </td><td> ≤ ± 2 </td></tr><tr><td> Maximum working vibration amplitude </td><td> 15mm (Theoretical value of a single actuator) </td></tr><tr><td> The maximum stroke of the piston </td><td> 120mm </td></tr><tr><td> Maximum screw extension </td><td> 450mm </td></tr><tr><td> Operating frequency range </td><td> 2-8Hz, infinitely adjustable </td></tr><tr><td> Counter maximum capacity </td><td> 1 time / rev, 99999999 </td></tr><tr><td> Loading frame size </td><td> designed according to test capacity </td></tr><tr><td> Pulsator displacement </td><td> 0-1600mL / time </td></tr><tr><td> Pulsator main motor power </td><td> 11/22 / 45kW </td></tr><tr><td> Number of fatigue test channels </td><td> 5，the pipeline is equipped with a switch device, which can perform single-point or multi-point synchronous fatigue test </td></tr><tr><td> Anchorage connector fatigue performance test ability </td><td> meet 2-35 hole simultaneous test </td></tr></tbody></table></p></div>
