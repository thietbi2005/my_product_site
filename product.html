<h1>HST 9000 CCD Optical Emission Spectrometer</h1><div><p> HST-TY9000 is Full Range of Solutions for the Entire Metals Industry. It use full-digital technology to replace bulky photomultiplier tube (PMT) simulation technology and keep pace with international spectrometer technology. The adoption of vacuum optical chamber design, full-digital excitation light source, advanced CCD detectors, and high-speed data readout system equips the device with high properties, ultra-low limit of detection (LOD), long-term stability and repeatability. The analytical precision can meet the requirements of laboratory standard, the analytical date is stable and reliable. Widely used in Metallurgy, casting, machinery processing and other industries incoming and outgoing product quality control. </p><p> Large Steel Plants Where needs are at around 10 PPM levels or elements like C, N, Cr, S, P etc. </p><p> testing Laboratories: Commercial Testing laboratories, Universities and colleges </p><p> Pure metal applications purity Al, Pb, Zn, Mg etc. â€“ most industrial users </p><p> Regulatory compliance Very low LODs to control Pb, Cd, As etc. </p><p> Foundries which need a quick analysis near the furnace </p><p> Manufacturing Facilities </p><p> Warehouse material identification </p><p> Base: Fe, Cu, Al, Ni, Co, Mg, Ti, Zn, Pb, Sn, Ag, etc </p></div>
