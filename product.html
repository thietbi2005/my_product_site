<h1>Coplanar Double Notch Making Machine </h1><div><p> This tester is used to make double-notches on the ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (PE-UHMW) molding material specimen, using it along with 50J pipe charpy impact Tester for the determination of double-notched charpy impact strength of PE-UHMW molded materials.It is also applicable for notch preparation of FNCT and PENT specimens. </p><p> ISO 9854, ISO16770-2004, ASTM F 1473 </p><p> 1. Knife thickness: 0.23mm±0.03mm </p><p> 2. Blade cutting angle: 14°±2° </p><p> 3. Blade width: 19mm </p><p> 4. Clamp opening range: 2mm to 20mm </p><p> 5. Specimen length range: 80mm to 120mm </p><p> 6. Residual width accurate: ±0.02mm </p><p> 7. Notch accurate: ±0.02mm </p><p> 8. Notch depth: 5.5,4.3,4,3,1.3mm </p><p> 1. May accomplish the preparation of two sides of the coplanar notch in one time. </p><p> 2.The unique structure design makes the notches and specimen centerline strictly coincident. </p><p> 3.The electronic micrometer is used for measuring the notching depth, largely guarantees the accuracy and consistency of both remaining width of the specimen. </p><p> 4.Double knives cutting &amp; double knives synchronization: in the notching process, the cutting force on both sides of the specimen is same, and the deformation at radial direction is invisibly. </p><p> 5. The knife blade is only subject to axial force without any lateral force, which largely increase the knife lifetime. </p></div>
