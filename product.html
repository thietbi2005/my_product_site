<h1>HST-CL03 Press Machine Numeral Display Equipment</h1><div><p><h3> Application </h3> HST-CL03 Press Machine Numeral Display Equipment is a kind of measuring equipment that is exploited in connection with press detect machine. It quite meets the need of national related detect standard, shows and prints interrelated data. It mainly applies in the production complement of extra fine grade press detect machine and the change of original pointer press machine. Main skill parameter Normal working voltage:~220V士10%V,50Hz Working environment temperature: 0 40C Power consumption:≤30VA Precision class:0.5 Size of print paper:56mm(width),32mm(diameter) Model of printing head:FTP-628MCL101#50 EPSON Function brief introduction 2.1 Time display: –year month day- -hour- minute 2.2 The group of pieces of Test code settings: 000 -0150. The user is free to set up In this range 2.3 Cross-section sample code set: 1— For the cross-section of 100mm x 100mm cube compressive specimen 2– For the cross-section of 150mm x 150mm cube compressive specimen 3– For the cos-section of 200mm x 200mm cube compressive specimen 4— For arbitrary cross-section sample of the cube compressive 5— For the cross section for the 150 x 150 x 550mm specimen bending 6—- For the cross section for the 100 x 100 x 400mm specimen bending 7– For the cross section for the 40 x 40 x 160mm specimen bending 8— For the cross-section of 70.7 x 70.7 compression cube specimens 2.4 Interface functions: Display window 1: show Pressure measurement or The peak pressure (KN) The lamp shows on the right of the window indicator: flashes when shows the peak, do not blink when that window shows a real-time pressure. Display window 2: Loading speed display KN/s Micro-printer; 16P in both Chinese and English parallel plate micro-pre-loaded printer paper Operation keys;: 0.-9 keyboard number keys, function keys to operate. 2.5 Data Storage: Equipment data stored in the internal chip set. When power on after power-down, the test data can be read out from the chip set for inquiry or printing. If the use of communications and computer software can also be connected to data storage devices to the computer or through network management center, to the realization of computer backup, data networking sharing centralized management center. Instrument No. including 000 ~ 9998 each test unit, including 3 or 6 date of test value and average intensity storage capacity of 150 groups. </p></div>
