<h1>Automatic Spring Tesinle and Compression Testing Machine</h1><div> Introduction: The machine was designed adopted the advanced experience of foreign manufacturers. The structure and rigidity of the machine are designed and manufactured for the precision inspection for small springs in strict accordance with the industry standard of the Ministry of Machinery. Features: ★ Four Test methods: fixed height measurement load, fixed load measurement height, fixed deformation measurement load, constant load measurement deformation; ★High-speed acquisition rate can be achieved under the premise of ensuring accuracy, which greatly improves the test efficiency; ★ Repeatable batch detection can be set for a single type of spring, and whether the spring is qualified or not is indicated by an indicator light; ★ High degree of automated inspection, complete the entire test process in one click; ★High precision, large range, and repeatability of force value; ★ Automatic judgment of data results, automatic analysis, real-time display; ★ Large amount of data storage, automatic storage, query and print; ★The electronic handwheel is loaded slowly, which can realize small deformation movement; ★ Chinese operation interface, simple, intuitive, easy to learn and understand, easy to operate for people of different ages; ★ Triple protection: sensor overload protection, photoelectric limit protection, mechanical limit protection; ★ spray plastic sheet metal, beautiful appearance, upper grade; ★ High cost performance, can replace similar foreign models. ★The display adopts industrial grade LCD screen, which has long life, stable performance and wide viewing angle.
