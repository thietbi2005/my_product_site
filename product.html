<h1>BJ600X Portable metallurgical microscope</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p>: BJ600X portable Metallographic Microscope is a precision optical microscope used for metallographic analysis and failure analysis of various large workpieces on site. On-site large workpieces do not need to be cut and sampled, and are directly ground and polished on the workpiece to ensure the integrity of the workpiece. After sample preparation, a portable metallographic microscope can be used for tissue analysis directly on the workpiece. This machine is used in aviation manufacturing, machinery manufacturing, vehicle manufacturing, boiler and pressure vessel manufacturing and inspection, petrochemical industry, railway shipbuilding, power plant, power station, equipment installation, large abrasive tools, safety inspection, quality supervision, physical and chemical Testing and other industries. The machine has a wide range of applications and is easy to operate. Technical Data: The machine model:BJ600X optical system:Finite distal chromatic difference correction optical system observing tube:Monocular observation cylinder eyepiece:Flat-field large-field eyepiece WF 10X / 20mm Camera interface:Standard 1X C interface </p></div>
