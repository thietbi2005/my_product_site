<h1>HST-HVS-2000ZTH 2kgf Auto-Turret Touch Screen Micro Vickers Hardness Tester</h1><div><p> The automatic brick tower microHardness Tester is mainly used for the micro-Vickers Hardness Test of various metals and some non-metallic materials. It can Test the hardness of various parts (machined parts, forgings, cast iron, steel castings, etc.), non-ferrous metals, heat-treated parts, various small and thin parts, glass, ceramics, agate, gemstones, etc. It is also suitable for the determination of the effective depth of carburization, quenching hardening layer, coating, surface coating and heat-affected parts of welded parts. It can also be used to observe the internal Metallographic structure of various metal parts and collect and display images. It is especially suitable for measuring the hardness gradient distribution curve of the workpiece and measuring the surface hardness and effective hardening layer depth of the gear after heat treatment. </p></div>
