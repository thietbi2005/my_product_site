<h1>HTS-PLS electro-hydraulic servo multi-channel coordinated loading test system</h1><div><h3>Application:</h3><p>PLS series electro-hydraulic servo multi-channel coordinated loading Test system is mainly used for automobile suspension system, body, chassis, etc., and can also carry out fatigue test of the whole vehicle. The test system adopts mature dynamic electro-hydraulic servo control and test technology, and is designed and manufactured by unitized, standardized and modular design means, which greatly improves the stability and reliability of the system. The key units and components of the system are adopted. Today's international advanced technology manufacturing. The test system can perform coordinated loading test of more than two channels, and can also carry out single-channel loading test. Each channel can be independent of each other, and the test mode is flexible and reliable. The test system targets automotive suspension systems, bodywork, chassis, etc., and can also perform fatigue Testing of the entire vehicle. It is also widely used in aircraft, ships, buildings, bridges and other fields.</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>dynamic</p></td><td><p>±5</p></td><td><p>±10</p></td><td><p>±15</p></td><td><p>±20</p></td><td><p>±25</p></td><td><p>±50</p></td><td><p>±100</p></td><td><p>±200</p></td><td><p>±500</p></td><td><p>±1000</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>±5</p></td><td><p>±10</p></td><td><p>±15</p></td><td><p>±20</p></td><td><p>±25</p></td><td><p>±50</p></td><td><p>±100</p></td><td><p>±200</p></td><td><p>±500</p></td><td><p>±1000</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>±75</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>Test force</p></td><td><p>Better than ±1% of the indication</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>±1% FS better than the indication</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>0.01-100</p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p>According to user requirements or specific test requirements</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
