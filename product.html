<h1>Extensometer for Rebar Connectors</h1><div><h3> Application: </h3><p> YYU-5/80-260mm special Extensometer for steel bar joints is designed in accordance with the technical requirements of "JGJ 107 2010 Technical Specifications for Technical Connection of Steel Bars". It is a two-way average extensometer specially used to Test the residual deformation of steel bar joints. Adjust according to the steel bar diameter requirement. </p> It fully complies with the technical requirements of "JGJ 107 2010 Technical Regulations for Reinforcement Connection". Deformation measurement gauge length: L1=L+4d In the formula: L1——deformation measurement gauge length; L — length of mechanical joint; d - the nominal diameter of the steel bar. One technical index: 1 gauge length: 80~260mm continuously adjustable, suitable for test requirements with a diameter of 12~40mm. 2 Measuring range: The maximum tensile range is 5mm, which meets the tensile requirements of all specifications of steel joints. 3 Accuracy grades Meet the requirements of grade 0.5 extensometers. Stretch the maximum measuring range 5mm. 0~1.5mm inward and return error meets the requirements of 0.5-level extensometer (meets the requirements of 0.6fyk residual elongation test) </div>
