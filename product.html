<h1>HST-HBM3000EG Gantry Brinell Hardness Tester</h1><div><p> The HST-HBM3000EG Gantry Brinell Hardness Tester is a new generation product of our company. It adopts the laTest fully automatic closed-loop sensor control technology. FEEDBACK the force process and the magnitude to the differential level, forever eliminating the overload or underload fluctuation caused by the hydraulic or motor deceleration error, or the friction of the spindle knife edge with the increase of the use time of the traditional weight and lever amplifying loading system. </p><p> The portal structure can precisely control the lifting, loading and unloading movements of the beam; </p><p> The main shaft components and load sensors are installed on the lifting beam; </p><p> The ball screw is directly driven by the stepless servo motor; </p><p> Test force from 62.5-3000Kgf; </p><p> Optional fully automatic measurement of Brinell hardness indentation. </p><p> The instrument adopts a gantry mechanism: it consists of a combined base, a mobile platform, a column, an upper beam, a precision ball screw, and a servo motor, among which the servo motor is an imported well-known brand. Beam lifting and loading and unloading movements can be precisely controlled. </p><p> Spindle components and load sensors are installed on the lifting beam. During the test, the size of the test force is sent to the control system through the sensor in time. There is also a movable worktable on the large platform. Driven by a stepping motor, the ball screw drives along the linear guide rail to make the tested workpiece enter and exit the test position. The operation console is equipped with a touch screen and an emergency stop button, and the adjustment of all test parameters and the control of test functions can be completed on the touch screen. The special numerical control system of the Hardness Tester is composed of a computer, a stepping motor, a driver, a load sensor, a signal converter and other components. During the test, the load signal is sent by the load sensor and transmitted to the numerical control processor. The precise action of the stepper motor is controlled by the numerical control processor, which realizes the full closed-loop control of the test force and ensures that the test force is strictly controlled within the allowable range. </p><p> The fully closed-loop control sensor loading technology is adopted, without any load impact error, the monitoring frequency is 100HZ, and the internal control accuracy of the whole process reaches 0.5%; the loading system is directly connected to the load sensor without any intermediate structure, and the load sensor directly measures and monitors the pressure head The load on the sensor is adjusted and adjusted, the coaxial loading technology, the lever-free structure, is not affected by friction and other factors; the lead screw lifting loading system of the non-traditional closed-loop control system uses double linear frictionless bearings to execute the probe stroke, so There is almost no need to consider the aging and errors caused by any lead screw system; </p><p> the accuracy of workpiece feeding, positioning, loading, load retention and automatic reset is ensured by stepping motor; </p><p> high-grade electrical control box, well-known brand electrical components, servo control system, etc.; </p><p> limit switch is used for all strokes to ensure the operation of the equipment in a safe area; except for the necessary exposed components, the rest adopts a cover structure. </p><p> computer touch screen control, ergonomic design, beautiful and practical. </p><p> The indentation was measured using a reading Microscope. Or fully automatic Brinell hardness measuring system. </p><p> The indenter can automatically return 50mm to protect the indenter and measuring mechanism from damage and corrosion due to high temperature. </p><p> The workpiece can be fixed by various customized toolings on the trapezoidal worktable, and the workpiece to be tested is placed on the worktable. The worktable carrying the workpiece can be moved along the linear guide rail to the bottom of the beam of the gantry through the control system to ensure that the workpiece with a diameter of 1200mm can be The beam passes through the gantry frame smoothly, and the beam is automatically lowered by the motor driven by the ball screw, nut and guide column at both ends. The position of the indenter is adjusted by the measurement and control software, and the beam is lowered to within 50mm from the surface of the workpiece. Enter Load, Save, and Uninstall Automatic Programs. </p><p> The downward movement of the beam (indenter) should be adjustable, and the distance between the indenter and the work table should be 50mm. </p><p> 1. Portal frame structure for Hardness Testing of large workpieces. </p><p> 2. The special numerical control system is adopted, and the closed-loop electronic control system applies the test force. </p><p> 3. The transmission part of the whole machine is completely composed of stepper motor and ball screw. </p><p> 4. The failure rate of the whole machine is low, the maintenance is time-saving and labor-saving, and no hydraulic oil is required. </p><p> 5. It is stable and reliable when used in environments with large temperature difference. </p><p> Determination of Brinell hardness of ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals and bearing alloys; </p><p> It has a wide range of applications and is suitable for precise measurement of parallel planes, and the measurement of curved surfaces is stable and reliable. </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p> Maximum height of test workpiece </p></td><td><p> 950mm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Control system </p></td><td><p> Computer touch screen control </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Measuring range: </p></td><td><p> 4-650HBW </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Test force </p></td><td><p> 62.5, 187.5, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 3000, kgf </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Motor Type </p></td><td><p> Servo Motor </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Transmission mode </p></td><td><p> ball screw </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Loading time </p></td><td><p> 1-99 seconds adjustable </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Distance between two columns </p></td><td><p> 1350mm (customizable) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Table moving distance </p></td><td><p> 1000mm (customizable) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Spindle lateral movement distance </p></td><td><p> 600mm (customizable) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Dimensions: host </p></td><td><p> 2000*1800*2180mm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Power supply </p></td><td><p> 220V, 50/60Hz </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Workbench size </p></td><td><p> 1500×1000mm (length×width) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Net weight </p></td><td><p> about 2500kg </p></td></tr></tbody></table><table><tbody><tr><td><p> Mainframe </p></td><td><p> 1 set </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> 20X reading microscope </p></td><td><p> 1 set </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Φ 2.5mm, 5mm, 10mm steel ball indenter </p></td><td><p> 1 set for each </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Industrial control computer </p></td><td><p> 1 set </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Accessories Box </p></td><td><p> 1 set </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Brinell hardness standard blocks </p></td><td><p> 2 pieces </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Optional </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Indentation Automatic Measurement System </p></td><td><p> 1 set </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Reading microscope with light source </p></td><td><p> 1 set </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Brinell hardness standard block </p></td><td><p> 1 set </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Special-shaped work platform </p></td><td><p> 1 set </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
