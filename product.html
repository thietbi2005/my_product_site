<h1>M-2 Metallographic Specimen Pre Grinding and Polishing Machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> and Feature of Grinding-Polishing Machine Model M-2 metallographic specimen pre-grinding machine is a kind of wet type pre-grinding machine. Taking advantage of various water-resistant sand papers with different granularity, it can be used to pre-grind various metal and alloy materials. By using this machine, manual grinding can be replaced by mechanical grinding so as to improve specimen preparing efficiency, also the deforming and heating traces produced during cutting can be removed completely. This will be suitable to observe and measure the Metallographic structure of specimen under microscope. </p> <h3> Main specification </h3> <table><tbody><tr><td> Model </td><td> M-2 </td></tr><tr><td> Grinding/Polishing Disc Diameter </td><td> 203mm </td></tr><tr><td> Grinding Disc Rotating Speed </td><td> 450 rpm（can be ordered） </td></tr><tr><td> Motor </td><td> YC7124  370 W </td></tr><tr><td> Dimension </td><td> 700×600×278mm </td></tr><tr><td> Weight </td><td> 45kg </td></tr><tr><td> Operating voltage </td><td> AC 220V,50Hz </td></tr></tbody></table></div>
