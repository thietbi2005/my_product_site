<h1>MoPao2DE Metallographic Specimen Grinding and Polishing Machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> and Feature of Grinding-Polishing Machine The grinding-polishing machine is a double-desktop, applicable to rough grinding, accurate grinding and polishing of Metallographic sample. The machine has microprocessor control system, with stepless speed of 50-600rpm or 150/300rpm two-level constant speed, thus widening its application. The machine has two control system, so it can be operated by two person meanwhile. The machine has a cooling device to cool the sample during grinding and polishing, thus preventing the damage of the metallographic structure caused by overheat of the sample. The machine, easy to use, safe and reliable, is an ideal preparation equipment for the labs of plants, research institutes and universities and colleges etc.. </p> <h3> Main specification </h3> <table><tbody><tr><td> Model </td><td> MoPao2DE </td></tr><tr><td> Diameter of polishing disc </td><td> φ203mm /φ250mm </td></tr><tr><td> Rotating speed of working disk </td><td> 50-600rpm (stepless speed changing) or 150/300rpm (two-level constant speed) </td></tr><tr><td> Grinding/polishing disc direction </td><td> Clockwise or anticlockwise </td></tr><tr><td> Working voltage </td><td> AC 220V 50HZ </td></tr><tr><td> Grinding/Polishing disc quantity </td><td> 2 </td></tr><tr><td> Motor </td><td> 250W </td></tr><tr><td> Dimensions </td><td> 690×735×310mm </td></tr><tr><td> Net weight </td><td> 55kg </td></tr></tbody></table></div>
