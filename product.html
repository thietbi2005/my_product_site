<h1>HST-HTR900M Automatic Rockwell Hardness Tester</h1><div><p> Test features: The test force are applied via a closed-loop control unit with a load cell, a DC motor and an electronicmeasurement and control unit replace traditional dead weights. The result is highly accurate measurementsatalltest loads up to 0.5%. Simple plug - and - play tech allows for much more quick and easy installation than traditional weightstypemachine. Manual handle wheel pre-load. Automatic main-load and testing cycle. l Extended dolphin nose allows verticaltest height of 300mm and throat depth of 220mm. Integrated casting body with more wide basement leads to permanent stability. RS232 and USB port to PC. Hardness Tester Basic functions: Twin tester--Regular Rockwell &amp; Rockwell Superficial hardness for metal and plastic material. Horizontal dolphin nose Indenter is suitable also for internal and external Testing. Testing on Surfaces difficult to reach. Testing internal surface of rings and tubes. Provided with many features such as high measuring precision, wide measuring range with30Rockwellscales. The Tester is suitable for testing of carbon steel, alloy steel, cast iron, non ferrous metal. Automatic testing cycle: Lifting of part, pre-loading, loading, dwell, unloading, results will befinishedautomatically. Measuring results digitally displaying and can be printed, or transmitted to external computer automaticallyby USB port. Test HR value can be converted to the value of HB, HV, HK and Ïƒb value. The tester meets all the following standard such as ISO 6508-2, ASTM E18. </p></div>
