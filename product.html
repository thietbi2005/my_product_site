<h1>ZXQ-5S Automatic Double Head Mounting Press</h1><div><p> Feature: Inlaying is a very important process of metallographic sample preparation, especially for some difficult holding tiny samples, irregularly shaped samples, or what needs for protecting edge and automatic grinding and polishing, inlaying is an essential step before sample preparation. ZXQ-5S automatic double head mounting press is an advanced hydraulic water-cooling machine. The whole process of inlaying is controlled by program, realizing one button operation of the process of heating, loading, holding, cooling and unloading. No need for operation personnel on duty, automatically complete the sample inlaying. You can optionally choose two of ф22mm, ф30mm, ф45mm three mold specifications and do inlaying at the same time, to meet the different needs of different customers. YZXQ-3 automatic double head mounting press has solidified the inlaying program, especially suitable for thermosetting materials, such as electricity jade powder and bakelite powder materials. To use YZXQ-3 automatic double head mounting press makes your sample preparation work more easily and more labor-saving and the inlaying quality better and more stable.
