<h1>HSTXG Series Plastic Pipe Hydrostatic Pressure Burst Tester</h1><div><h3> Application: </h3><p> HSTXG Series Plastic Pipe Hydrostatic Pressure Tester is mainly used to determine the resistance of thermoplastics pipes and short-time hydraulic burst to constant internal water pressure at constant temperature. It is applicable to thermoplastic pipes intended for the conveyance of fluids. </p><p> It confirms to ISO1167,ASTM D1598 It is under the standard of ISO 1167, ASTM D1598, ISO9080, CJ/T108 , ASTM F1335 and ASTM D1599. </p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><p> Max Pressure </p></td><td><p> 0-10MPa </p><p> (16MPa, 25MPa as option) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Control range of water box </p></td><td><p> RT~95℃ </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Pressure resolution </p></td><td><p> 0.001Mpar(0.01bar or 1PSI) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> No. of Test positions </p></td><td><p> 3 (1-40 selectable) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Test pipe diameter range </p></td><td><p> D2~1600 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Control method </p></td><td><p> Industrial PC(touch screen) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Timing range </p></td><td><p> 1s~9,999h </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Time resolution </p></td><td><p> 1s </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> 1.Operating terminal with touch screen test parameter settings. </p><p> 2.On less than 1m2 area, up to 50 different pressures including the pressure water supply. </p><p> 3.It is intelligent to distinguish the size and material of specimen, then provide optimized pressure rising solution and algorithm. </p><p> 4.High accuracy pressure control. Selectively adjustable input pressure in each individual module reduces the wearing of solenoid valves, endures a long service life. </p><p> 5.All metal components that come into contact with the medium are made of high-quality stainless steel. </p><p> 6.Operator-friendly display interface provides multi languages to suit the most varied customer requirements. </p><p> 7.Multistage protections are from electric partt, mechanical part as well as software. </p></div>
