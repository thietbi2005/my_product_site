<h1>HSCS-8800S High Frequency Infrared Carbon Sulfur Analyzer For Ore Industry</h1><div><p> Summary: </p><p> HSCS-8800S High-frequency Infrared Carbon &amp; Sulfur Analyzer is suitable for multi field and all around. Carbon and sulfur analyzer combines with high-frequency induction burner, it is a high-tech product the which based on light, machine, electricity, computer, analytical skills, it has characteristics of wide measuring range and the results of analysis is accuracy and reliable. Because of adopting computer technology, intelligent equipment, screen display, text and data collection, deal with problems and so on have reached the advanced the world level, more industries detect carbon and sulfur elements in this analysis equipment. The key components adopt high quality elements to ensure the instrument stability and high quality. </p><h3> Application: </h3><p> HSCS-8800S High-frequency Infrared Carbon &amp; Sulfur Analyzer is used to new power energy, metallurgy, mechanical, mine, inspection, nuclear industry, coal, automobile, shipping, aviation, building materials, university, geology, petrochemical and so on. It is used to measure mass fraction of carbon and sulfur in steel, iron, alloy, casting core sand, nonferrous metals, cement, ore, coke, catalyst, magnetic materials, ceramics, inorganic matter, graphite, refractory materials, battery materials, plants and other materials. </p><p> Features: </p><p> Infrared Detect System The circuit design: the whole machine adopts modular design, highly integrated electronic circuits, it is very stable and reliable, meanwhile, it is adopted multi-level isolation so as to resolve high frequency interference thoroughly. Sampling: it is adopted 32-bit sampling chip which belongs to America Analog Devices Company so it has fast speed and high precision. The Communication: it is adopted USB new data exchange technology, so it greatly improves the communication speed. The Power Supply: it is adopted high quality linear integrated military-grade power module, its output stable and there is no problem. Light Source: special new type platinum infrared light source, it is efficient and its spectral stability. The Analysis of pool: Gold-plated carbon and sulfur analysis pool and High-precision pyroelectric infrared detector. The Motor: special aviation motor, its thermal stability well, it has a long service life. </p><p> High-frequency Burning System High Frequency Circuit: it is adopted Self-excited directional coupler take power FEEDBACK, it ensures that output power is consistent, and it makes samples fully burned. It is stable. High-frequency High Power Circuit Design: it is adopted 7.5kvA high-frequency pipe( actually its use power more than 2.5kvA, can not add sample with empty burn), it is reduced the load on high-frequency combustion systems, and it improves service life. Military Products: Ceramic high-power tube and ceramic vacuum capacitor (100A). High-frequency control circuit: It can detect the electromagnetic valve itself, lifting cylinder and the working conditions of high-frequency furnace. 1, The main circuit over-current and timeout protection: it ensures that high-frequency furnace has a normal working conditions. 2, The analysis of air flow volume adopts high precision flowmeter, the results of analysis is more stable and reliable. 3, High-frequency furnace has metal filter with micropore, it ensures that dust and gas completely separated. 4, Air pressure burner automatic cleaning device, it clean it up thoroughly, to reduce the impact of dust on the result of the analysis. </p><p> Parameter: </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p> Items </p></td><td><p> Index </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Analysis theory </p></td><td><p> High-frequency furnace burn infrared absorptive detection. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Range of measurement </p></td><td><p> C: 0.000001%～99.999999% </p><p> S: 0.000001%～99.999999% </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Analytical error </p></td><td><p> Accord with ISO9556/ ISO4935/ JJG395-97 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Analysis precision </p></td><td><p> C:≤RSD0.5%.
