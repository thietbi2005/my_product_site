<h1>Video Measuring Microscope VMM-D Series</h1><div><p> Product name：Video Measuring microscope VMM-D Series Product categories：Microscopes Abstract： VMM-D series, an integrated high-magnification, micron-industry-aimed measuring instruments developed by HST Group. a.High magnification inspectioon b.High accuracy micron-level measurment c.High cost performance d.Combination of DRO and software met </p><p> Purpose </p><p> The VMM-D series video measurement microscope is an integrated high magnification, micrometer level industrial measurement instrument developed by HST-Group Company. </p><p> Combined with powerful microscopic detection technology, it has been widely applied in many fields such as: </p><p> 1. It is used as an observation microscope to detect the surface finish of workpieces by Comparative law, identify ore samples in the metallurgical industry, conduct photo printing Test, and inspect fibers in textiles. </p><p> 2. Measure the length in Cartesian coordinates. For example, measuring spacing, base distance, scoring distance, scoring width, slot width, slot width, through-hole outer diameter, etc. </p><p> 3. Measure the angle of complex components such as dials, templates, gauges, drilling templates, etc. </p><p> 4. With powerful metrology software on the PC side, there are not only microscopes, but also visual measurement systems, and more surprises waiting for you. </p><p> II. characteristic </p><p> 1. The survey has a bright field of view, a positive image, and a clear picture. </p><p> 2. Long working distance lens with a magnification of up to 2800 times. </p><p> 3. Accurate and stable transmission, low friction, and long service life. </p><p> 4. Electric Z-axis, which can achieve high-precision automatic focusing. </p><p> 5. The X-axis and Y-axis are designed with built-in zero switches, which can be locked when needed. </p><p> 6. Cooperate with powerful software HST-M ™， Can measure most 2D data and export measurement results as AutoCAD files and other reports. </p><table><tbody><tr><td> Model </td><td><p> VMM-3020D </p></td><td><p> VMM-4030D </p></td><td><p> VMM-5040D </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> （X*Y*Z，mm） </p></td><td><p> 300*200*150 </p></td><td><p> 400*300*150 </p></td><td><p> 500*400*150 </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> 670 x 660 x 950 </p></td><td><p> 720*950*1020 </p></td><td><p> 800*1040*1020 </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> 260 </p></td><td><p> 315 </p></td><td><p> 500 </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> for example，y ≤ (3.0+L/200) μm </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> Exy ≤ (3.5+L/300)μm </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> 1/0.5μm </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> TEO™ 1/2” Color CCD camera </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> Infinity-corrected optical system </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> WF10X(Ø22mm) </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> PL 5X,10X,20X,50XPL </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> Intilted quintuple nosepiece for bright field </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> Coaxial coarse and fine adjustment, coarse adjustment distance 32mm,precision of fine adjustment:0.002mm,with tense adjusting device to prevent gliding. </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> 6V 30W/12V 50W halogen and brightness adjustable. </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Integrated field diaphragm,aperture diaphragm and pullerty pepolarizer </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Equipped with frosted glass,yellow/green/blue filters </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> 2800x(Objective* 1/2’’ CCD Camera) </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> 150mm </p></td></tr><tr><td></td><td><p> AC110V/60Hz, 220V/50Hz </p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> *According to our company’s Testing standard L is measured length (units: mm) </p><p> Specifications subject to change without notice. </p></div>
