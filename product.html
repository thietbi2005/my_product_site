<h1>MPJ-1A Grinding Machine/Lapping Machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p>: MPJ-1A model grinding machine is mainly used for the surface of spectral analysis sample and metal,ceramic,glass and other devices such as polishing.The machine has compact structure,single wheel speed,grinding wheel with different grain size,hardness.This machine is a smooth rotation,low noise,convenient operation,high efficiency.It is suitable for factories,scientific research institution. 2. MAIN CHARACTERISTICS Humanization design:Operational plane with adjustable height and the scientific design make the grinding workpiece easier. Safety sample preparation:Safe design of the sampling window and the irregular sample clamp with option protect the users'safety. Powerful dust:Compared with the aditional dust methods,MPJ-1A has nearly 100% dust effect,convenient to collect dust,which makes your laboratory more cleaner. High-efficiency grinding:Large power motor(2KW) with two level speed makes the grinding efficiency more higher.The sample processing time is not more than 20s.Even though there is more loads,it is still more reliable. 3.
