<h1>Multi-functional Weather Acclerated UV Chamber</h1><div><p> Introduction: </p> Favorably Priced Environmental Chamber Weather Aging UV Chamber is another type of light aging Testing machine simulating lighting,mainly UV in sunlight.  It is able to simulate the damage created by nature rain and dew via exposing Test samples to under-controlled interaction cycle of sunlight and moisture and rising temperature.  The UV weather test chamber adopts Ultraviolet fluorescent to simulate sunlight and, at the same time simulate moisture influence through condensation or spray.

Each condensation cycle selectable illumination light 4H, 4H condensation or 8H light, 4H condensing: two kinds of cycles. 4 After the first light 400 ~ 450H, every row need to be replaced with a fluorescent lamp.  Other lamps in accordance with the light cycle and replace Way to replace the lamp to compensate for losses caused by lamp aging.  This mode of operation is to ensure that each lamp life is between 1600 ~ 1800H. 5 When replacing the lamp, a water dish should be dry and clean, avoid the formation of scale. Test samples and performance evaluation for Buyer 1. Appearance assessment: the appearance of the coating is mainly assessed, and can also be visually assessed Plastic and Rubber necessary.  The check project is mainly for gloss, color change, chalking, spots, blisters, cracks and dimensional stability, etc.  Should try to use the instrument to do Quantitative detection, such as gloss, colorimeter. 2 Evaluation of the mechanical and other properties: tensile strength of general rubber material, elongation, hardness measurement, the measurement red plastic Impact strength, elongation at break, tensile strength, flexural strength, if necessary, may require additional performance testing projects. </div>
