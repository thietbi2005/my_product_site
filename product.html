<h1>MP-2B Metallographic Specimen Grinding and Polishing Machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> and Feature of Grinding-Polishing Machine The grinding-polishing machine is a double-disc desktop, operated by two people simultaneously, applicable to pre-grinding, grinding and polishing of Metallographic sample. The machine regulates its speed by a frequency changer, with a speed of 50-1000rpm, thus widening its application. The machine is an indispensable equipment in making the metallographic sample. The machine has a cooling device to cool the sample during pre-grinding, thus preventing the damage of the metallographic structure caused by overheat of the sample. The machine, easy to use, safe and reliable, is an ideal preparation equipment for the labs of plants, research institutes and universities and colleges. </p> <h3> Main specification </h3> <table><tbody><tr><td> Model </td><td> MP-2B </td></tr><tr><td> Grinding Disc Diameter </td><td> 230mm </td></tr><tr><td> Polishing Disc Diameter </td><td> 200mm </td></tr><tr><td> Grinding Disc Rotating Speed </td><td> 50-1000rpm(stepless speed) </td></tr><tr><td> Motor </td><td> 550 W </td></tr><tr><td> Dimension </td><td> 700x600x278mm </td></tr><tr><td> Weight </td><td> 50kg </td></tr><tr><td> Operating voltage </td><td> AC 220V,50Hz </td></tr></tbody></table></div>
