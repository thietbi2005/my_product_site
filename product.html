<h1>HST-HVS-AT-XY  Semi- Automatic Micro Vickers Hardness Tester</h1><div><p> HST-HVS-AT-XY Semi- Automatic Micro Vickers Hardness Tester is integrated with several new technologies such as optical imaging, mechanical displacement, electronic control, digital imaging, image analysis, computer processing and so on. It controls the Micro vickers hardness tester and automatic Test table by the computer, and displays the indentation image on the computer screen. By means of automatic reading and manual reading, it accurately measures the HV hardness, hardening depth, film thickness, distance between two points of metals and some non-metallic materials and various films. It also can shoot metal surface morphology and taking fixed rate printing etc. This system breaks through the traditional test method, realize the Hardness Test of fully automatic, high precision, high repeatability, and it is the important equipment for materials analysis. </p></div>
