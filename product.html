<h1>HST-DIT1800E Ejection Impact Testing Machine</h1><div><p> The ejection Drop Weight Impact Testing machine is mainly a testing equipment for Testing the impact resistance of various metal and non-metal pipes and plates (including various non-metal materials such as plastics, ceramics, nylon, building materials, etc.). The impact force value sensor and Test system are used, and the high-speed data acquisition card uses the oscilloscope impact sensor to measure the load and deformation transient values during the fracture process of the impacted sample, that is, the impact absorbed energy, the force-displacement-energy curve and the curve during the impact process. </p><p> ASTM D 7136/D 7136M-05,ASTM D 3763-02,ASTM E 23-07a </p></div>
