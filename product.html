<h1>Xenon Weathering Test Chambber</h1><div><p> Product Description Programmable Xenon Accelerated Aging Test Chamber can simulate damages caused by sunlight, rain and dew.    By simulating the effect of sunlight and using condensed moisture for rain and dew, test material exposed to temperature-controlled interaction cycle of sunlight and moisture can help get results of damage which may take months or even years instead of several days or weeks to achieve the same effect.    The artificial accelerated aging test data could help select new materials, update existing materials, and evaluate how the change of product mix effects the product induration. Programmable Xenon Accelerated Aging Test Chamber Standards met: ISO 4892-2:2006 ISO 11507 GB/T 14522 Parameters: Dimensions of the working chamber: 950×950×850mm(W*H*D) Dimensions: 1450mm×1950mm×1400mm(W*H*D) Temperature range: Room temperature+10℃~80℃±3℃ Temperature uniformity: ≤2℃ Lamp rated power: 6 KW (Air-cooled) Lamp life: average 2000h Lamp wavelength: 290-800nm Irradiance fluctuation: irradiator control precision≤10% Relative humidity range: 50%±5%/65%±5% Blackboard temperature: 65±3℃ Blackboard size: 70MM*40MM*5MM specimen holder size: 100mm*70mm  20pieces Total power: 11KW </p></div>
