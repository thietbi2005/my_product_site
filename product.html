<h1><div id='entire'><h1>MIKROSIZE SURFACE.ROUGHNESS.TESTER.SENSOR.</h1><div> <table><tbody><tr><td><p>Standard Sensor</p></td><td><p>SRT-SS</p></td><td><p>Suitable for measuring the surface roughness of planes and shafts. When measuring the inner surface roughness of holes, it can be used for holes with a diameter greater than 6mm, with a maximum depth of 22mm. (Included in the standard equipment package.)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Small Hole Sensor</p></td><td><p>SRT-SH</p></td><td><p>Capable of measuring the surface roughness of holes with a diameter greater than 2mm, with a maximum depth of 9mm. It can also be used for measuring planes and cylindrical surfaces.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Curved Surface Sensor</p></td><td><p>SRT-CS</p></td><td><p>Designed for measuring the surface roughness of concave and convex curved workpieces with a radius of curvature greater than 3mm. It can also be used for suitable planes and cylindrical surfaces in conjunction with a measuring platform.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Deep Groove Sensor</p></td><td><p>SRT-DGS</p></td><td><p>Applicable for measuring the surface roughness of grooves with a width greater than 3mm and a depth less than 10mm, or steps with a height less than 10mm. It can also be used for measuring planes and cylindrical surfac- es when used with a measuring platform.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Extended Probe</p></td><td><p>SRT-EP</p></td><td><p>For measuring the surface roughness within grooves that have a width</p><p>greater than 1mm and a depth less than 13mm.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Extension Rod</p></td><td><p>SRT-ER</p></td><td><p>Can extend the length of various sensors by 50mm. It is beneficial for measuring deep holes and can be equipped with two extension rods if necessary.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Adapter Rod</p></td><td><p>SRT-AR</p></td><td><p>Enables lateral movement of the measuring mechanism for surface rough- ness measurement.</p></td></tr></tbody></table> </div></div></div>
