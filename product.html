<h1>HST-HBRV187.5STE Digital Universal hardness testers</h1><div><p> Main features 1.Equipped Brinell, Rockwell, Vickers Test methods 2.Electronic and electric loading, high precision sensor, with a unique closed-loop control system 3. Eyepiece structure with digital encoder, measuring D1, D2 value, LCD directly display hardness value and D1, D2 value 4.Directly select the hardness scale, the force value automatically changes in the test parameters 5.The test force is automatically corrected, and each force is automatically compensated. The accuracy of the force is improved by an order of magnitude 6.Can be calibrated according to standard hardness block or length scale 7.The test force can be automatically corrected by standard dynamometer 8.The hardness values of brinell, rockwell and vickers can be converted 9.Touch screen, easy to operate 10.Automatic hardness conversion according to national standard /ASTM 11.Set password protection setting parameters, more sample and test information 12. U-disk of measurement data is saved in EXCEL format for easy editing and processing Technical specification Model:HST-HBRV187.5STE Test force:5～250 kgf Brinell scale:HBW1/ HBW2.5/62. HBW1/10 HBW2.5/15.62 HBW1/30、HBW2.5/31.2 HBW2.5/62. HBW10/100、HBW5/12 HBW2.5/187.5 </p></div>
