<h1>HST-HWN Computer Controlled Electronic Bending and Torsion Testing Machine</h1><div><p> Introduction: Our HST-HWN series electronic bending and Torsion Testing Machines are suitable for bending and torsion Testing of pillar insulators. They can be used for pillar insulators, composite insulators, pin insulators, rod insulators, rod composite insulators, glass insulators, lightning arresters, and sheaths. Bending and torsion testing of insulators, porcelain core rods, composite core rods, bushings, hollow insulators, wall bushings, etc. Meet the bending Test, torsion test, deflection test under load and mechanical test one by one for pillar porcelain insulators of 1000kV and below. The processing of all parts of the company's products is controlled by the ISO9001 quality management system. Key outsourced components are all imported, which effectively improves the accuracy and long-term stability of the equipment. Parameters: 1. Maximum specimen height: 1500mm 2.
