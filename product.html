Because of adopting computer technology, intelligent equipment, screen display, text and data collection, deal with problems and so on have reached the advanced the world level, more industries detect carbon and sulfur elements in this analysis equipment. The key components adopt high quality elements to ensure the instrument stability and high quality. </p><h3> Application: </h3><p> CS-8820 High-Frequency Infrared Carbon &amp; Sulfur Analyzer is used to measure mass fraction of carbon and sulfur in steel, iron, alloy, casting core sand, nonferrous metals, cement, ore, coke, catalyst, magnetic materials, ceramics, inorganic matter, graphite, refractory materials, battery materials, plants and other materials. And mainly used in new energy, metallurgy, mechanical, mine, inspection, nuclear industry, coal, automobile, shipping, aviation, food, aerospace, building materials, university, geology, petrochemical and so on. </p><p> Feature: </p><p> Infrared Carbon &amp; Sulfur Analyzer 1.Circuit: The entire device adopts double-CPU design, with high-integration electronic circuits to achieve stability and reliability. Meanwhile, it adopts multi-level concealed separation circuit using optical fiber transmission to thoroughly solve the problem of high-frequency interference. 2.Power: Industrial integrated linear modular power provides stable power output with no malfunction. 3.Light Source: Special new platinum infrared light source generates continuing heat and has high spectral efficiency. 4.Analysis Pool: Gilded carbon and sulfur analysis pool and high-precision pyroelectric infrared detectors. High-Frequency Combustion Furnace 1.High-Frequency Circuit: High-power high-frequency circuit design and ceramic vacuum capacitor can help system do vacuum combustion without samples so that the system reduces load of high-frequency combustion system and improves service lifespan. 2.Control Circuit: Automatic detection of electromagnetic valves, lifting cylinders and high-frequency working conditions. 3.Safety System: Automated overtime and overflow alarm ensures high-frequency furnace under normal condition. 4.Gas Path Structure: Inlet Gas Path System (electromagnetic valves, pipe joints and lifting cylinders) can automatically check leakage. 5.Dust Removal System: Furnace end auto-cleaning device and patent technology of ash discharge system. The dust removal system adopts to achieve good airtightness and purification as well as convenient replacement. It can reduce impact from dust on analysis results. 6.Furnace Body Structure: Low-pressure heating and furnace end constant temperature improves conversion rate of sulfur and makes the analytical results of sulfur stable. Random Software 1.Analysis Passage: The software provides the function of passage management so that passages of carbon and sulfur can automatically add, delete and edit without limitations in number. 2.Sample Management: It is available to edit names and marks of samples, and add and delete sample names. 3.Display Function: A curve box for carbon and sulfur each. The system monitors real-time data and release curves of carbon and sulfur during the process of analysis. 4.Data Processing Function: The analysis results are stored by ACCESS database. It is available to store all data and curves from every analysis of carbon and sulfur. 5.Search Function: Users can search in terms of time, operators, sample names and marks. 6.Software Function: The system provides multiple functions such as curve/data storage, void removal, parametric settings, passage selection, mathematical statistics, result correction and curve comparison. 7.Printing Function: Printing modes diversify. The system provides two printing modes, i.e., Testing laboratory and detection station, and users can voluntarily design printing formats. 8.Self-Diagnostic Function: The software can realize airtightness of furnace end and gas chamber. Configuration of Computer and Printer 1.Microcomputer: Brand commercial microcomputers.(Mainstream standard configuration, can be selected according to user requirements) 2.Printer: Laser printer (A4 paper) (Mainstream standard configuration, can be selected according to user requirements).
