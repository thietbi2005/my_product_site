<h1>XQ-2B metallographic specimen inlaying machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p>: Model XQ-2B metallographic specimen mounting presses suitable for the thermo-hardening plastic pressing of the small Metallographic specimen which is not idiomorphic or hard to take.After forming, it will be very easy to process the grinding, polishing of the specimen and it is also convenient to process measuring of metallographic structure under metallographic microscope. The machine may work stablely under the following working condition: l The temperature of surrounding medium can not be less than 10 ℃ and more than 40℃ l The relative humidity of air should be no more than 85% (20 ℃) l The voltage fluctuation should be no more than 15% l There should be no obvious vibration source around l There should be no current conducting dust, explosive and corrosive air. </p> <h3> Main specification </h3> <table><tbody><tr><td> Model </td><td> XQ-2B </td></tr><tr><td> Mould diameter </td><td> 22mm / 30mm / 45mm </td></tr><tr><td> Heater specifications </td><td> ≤ 800W AC 220V 50Hz </td></tr><tr><td> Temperature adjusting range </td><td> 0-400 ℃ </td></tr><tr><td> power supply </td><td> single phase, 220V, 50Hz </td></tr><tr><td> Net weight </td><td> 35Kg </td></tr><tr><td> Dimension </td><td> 260×360×450mm </td></tr></tbody></table></div>
