<h1>HST-MoPao5T Metallographic Specimen Grinding and Polishing Machine</h1><div><p> The HST-MoPao5T automatic grinding and polishing machine is a single-disc desktop machine, which is an integrated machine with central force pressurization and single-point pressurization. It is a new generation of high-precision, automated sample preparation process grinding and polishing equipment manufactured in accordance with international standards and using international advanced technology. Equipped with a high-quality electronic proportional valve, the grinding and polishing pressure can be adjusted steplessly and intuitively. The rotation direction of the grinding and polishing disc can be selected arbitrarily, and the grinding and polishing disc can be quickly replaced; it has multiple sample holders, pneumatic single-point loading and center loading and other functions. This machine adopts an advanced microprocessor control system, which makes the rotation speed of the grinding and polishing disc and grinding and polishing head infinitely adjustable, and the sample preparation pressure and time settings are intuitive and convenient. Just replace the grinding and polishing disc or sandpaper and fabric to complete the grinding and polishing process. This enables the machine to exhibit a wider range of applicability. It has the characteristics of stable rotation, safety and reliability, low noise and the use of cast aluminum base to increase the rigidity of grinding and polishing.          </p><p> - All-in-one machine for central force pressurization and single-point pressurization </p><p> - One machine with multiple functions, easily completes pre-grinding, rough grinding, fine grinding, rough polishing and fine polishing of Metallographic samples </p><p> -Three-stage fixed speed, stepless speed change, speed control system optimized for grinding and polishing machines </p><p> - Easy-to-control LCD screen, simple operation </p><p> - Finely ground and surface-treated work disc to ensure smooth sample surface </p><p> - The integrally formed high-strength fiberglass material shell is sturdy and durable. </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p> Model </p></td><td><p> HST-MoPao5T </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Grinding Disc Diameter </p></td><td><p> φ250mm (φ230mm, φ300mm can be customized) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Grinding and polishing disc speed </p></td><td><p>  50-1000 r/min (stepless speed regulation) and 300/600/900 r/min (3-level fixed speed) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Grinding and polishing disc steering </p></td><td><p> adjustable forward and reverse selection </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Grinding and polishing head speed </p></td><td><p> 5-150 r/min (stepless speed regulation) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Number of prepared samples </p></td><td><p> 6 pcs </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Loading range </p></td><td><p> Single point 20-70N, center 150-300N </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Sample preparation time </p></td><td><p> 0-3000S </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Sample diameter </p></td><td><p> Factory standard φ30mm (can be customized with diameters φ22-φ45mm) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Machine Dimensions </p></td><td><p> 750*590*720mm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Packing Dimensions </p></td><td><p> 870*640*770mm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Net weight </p></td><td><p> 62kg </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Gross Weight </p></td><td><p> 80 </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Total power </p></td><td><p> 1.1KW </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Power supply </p></td><td><p> Single phase 220V, 50HZ </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
