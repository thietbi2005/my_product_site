<h1>HV-5 Digital Vickers Hardness Tester</h1><div><p> 1. The vickers hardness tester is a new and high-tech product combining the optical, mechanical and electronic techniques, with a good aesthetic aspect, operational functions and reliability, and hence it is an ideal instrument for the Testing of Vickers hardness. 2. The instrument adopts closed-loop loading control system, it makes the Test accuracy improved and the repeatability and stability of the value better. 3. With the soft keys on panel board for input operation: l Arbitrarily choose the test force. l Preset the testing force dwell time. l Adjust intensity of light source. l Read the indentation length and after input it shows the hardness value and the number of measurements. 4. The instrument is suitable for the testing Vickers hardness value of the micro and thin pieces, permeated and coated plane surface, the crisp materials such as the agate, glass and it is, therefore, an ideal hardness measuring instrument for the scientific research institutes, the universities, the industrial production units and the metrological institutes. 5. According to the particular requirements of the client, the tester can be equipped with CCD indentation automatically measuring device.
