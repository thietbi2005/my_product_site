<h1>Face Mask Particulate Filtration Efficiency Testing Equipment</h1><div><p> Product description:   Automatic Filter (Mask) tester (Medical) is used to Test the filter efficiency and differential pressure of fold mask, medical face mask and cup mask.   For filter efficiency test, this machine can do single-machine for dual-aerosol (both oily and salty particles). Customers can choose double generator or single generator according to their own needs. Additional clean air source system is required if you choose the double-generator.   Standards:   YY0469-2011 5.6.2 Particulate Protection Standard   Application:   Product use: masks, disposable masks, non-woven masks, medical protective masks       Technical Specification：   l Air source system:   Exhaust volume: 10 ± 100L / M Solid aerosol particle size: 0.075 ± 0.02um Concentration: ≤200mg / m3   l Product model:  SUP_GLXT l Basic principle: Use an aerosol generator to generate a certain concentration of gas, and then use a photometer to measure the gas concentration to detect the particle size before and after breathing l NaCl concentration: 200mg / m3 l Flow accuracy: 10-100L / min, accuracy 2% l Test medium: NaCl l Pressure: 500pa l Number of samples: 1 way l Structure composition: particle generator, flow detection device, concentration detection device. </p></div>
