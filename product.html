<h1>GLY Series Optical Fiber Cable Tensile & Crush Testing Machine</h1><div><p> These machines offer force, displacement or deformation closed loop Testing. The load frames are rigid constructed, providing superior axial and lateral stiffness. <h3> Method E1: Tensile performance </h3><em>This measuring method applies to optical fiber cables which are Tested at a particular tensile strength in order to </em><em>examine the</em><em>behavior of the attenuation and/or the fiber elongation strain as a function of the load on a cable which may occur </em><em>during</em><em>installation. This method is intended to be non-destructive (the tension applied shall be within the operational values).</em><h3> Method E3: Crush </h3><em>The purpose of this test is to determine the ability of an optical fiber cable to withstand crushing.</em></p><table><tbody><tr><td> Applications </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Tensile performance Per IEC-60794-1-2 Method E1 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Object This measuring method applies to optical fiber cables, which are tested at particular tensile strength in order to examine the behavior of the attenuation and the fiber elongation strain as a function of the load on a cable, which may occur during installation and/or operation Sample The cable length under test us 150 meters, Additional cable length is needed to connect the fibers to be tester Apparatus The apparatus consists of An attenuation measuring apparatus, typically an OTDR A fiber elongation strain measuring apparatus based on dispersion testing equipment A specially designed tensile Test machine capable of tensioning 150 meters of optical cable in six legs of 25 meters each. The machine is equipped with a motor for controlled tensioning and a load cell for measuring the actual tension applied on the cable. Procedure The cable is wound in the machine over appropriately sized sheaves. The cable ends extend to reach the measuring instruments. A pre-determined number of fibers within the cable are concatenated by fusion splicing. Typically, two sets of fibers are used, one will serve to measure attenuation change and the other serves for elongation monitoring. After all initial measurements and calibration are carried out, the cable is pulled at a specified rate until a pre-determined tension is applied. The cable is laid to rest under tension as per detail specifications, and then the attenuation and fiber length are measured. This process may involve several tensile levels in order to characterize the entire tensile behavior of the cable, or be carried out only at the defined maximum allowed tension level. Pass/Fail criteria 1. Under load, the fiber attenuation is not increased more than a predetermined value, typically 0.05dB over fiber length measured 2. Under load, the fiber does elongation by more than a pre-determined value over its initial length. The allowed elongation under installation load is typically 0.25% </td></tr></tbody></table><img src=https://www.hssdgroup.com/uploads/180719/1-1PG9103351X3.png><img src=https://www.hssdgroup.com/uploads/180719/1-1PG910345T14.png><img src=https://www.hssdgroup.com/uploads/180719/1-1PG910361LW.png><table><tbody><tr><td> Main specifications </td><td></td></tr><tr><td> Load capacity: </td><td> 100kN for tension, 10kN for crush test </td></tr><tr><td> Accuracy class: </td><td> ±1% </td></tr><tr><td> Measuring range: </td><td> 1%-100% </td></tr><tr><td> Crush platen: </td><td> 100mm×100mm，hardness:HB240～280 </td></tr><tr><td> loading speed: </td><td> 0.2～300mm/min </td></tr><tr><td> Deformation measuring accuracy: </td><td> ±0.5% </td></tr><tr><td> Displacement measuring accuracy: </td><td> ±0.3% </td></tr><tr><td> Elongation measurement: </td><td> 1. gauge length：1000mm 2. Measuring resolution is better than 10μm 3. Accuracy is better than ±0.5%. </td></tr><tr><td> Crosshead travel: </td><td> 800～1100mm </td></tr><tr><td> 4. General Specifications 5. Load Measurement Accuracy: 6. ±1% of reading to 1/100 of load weighing system capacity meets or exceeds the requirements of the following standards: ISO 7500-1, EN 10002-2, ASTM E4, JIS B7721. 7. Strain Measurement Accuracy: 8. ±0.5% of reading to 1/50 of full scale with most ASTM E83 class B or ISO 9513 class 0.5 extensometers meets or exceeds ASTM E83, ISO 9513, and EN 10002-4. 9. Speed Accuracy: 10. Set speed＜0.05% Max. speed: ±1% Set speed ≥0.05% Max. speed:±0.5% 11. Position measurement accuracy: 12. ±0.01% of reading or 0.0001 mm, whichever is greater 13. Power supply: 14. Standard optional voltages 220/240VAC, 50-60 Hz, Power must be free of spikes and surges exceeding 10% of the nominal voltage. 15. Operating Temperature: 16. 0 to +38°C (+32 to +100°F) 17. Humidity Range: 18. 10% to 90% non-condensing, 19. Storage Temperature: 20. -40 to +66°C (-40 to +150°F) 21. Note: 22. Extra wide and/or extra height frames are available. 23. Power supply system is completely customizable. 24. Specifications are subject to change without notice. </td></tr></tbody></table></div>
