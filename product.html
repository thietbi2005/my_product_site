<h1>HV-1000Z Digital Micro Vickers Hardness Tester</h1><div><p> 1. The Micro Vickers Hardness Tester is a new type high-tech product combining the optical, mechanic and electronic techniques; with a novel and pleasing appearance, operational functions and reliability, besides, it has a special characteristic that the indenter and the objective switching are automatically rotated to complete, hence it is an ideal instrument for the Testing of micro-hardness. 2. Made with a precise design in the field of mechanics, CPU control of the testing process in the electric field, and adopted the highly clear optic Testing system in the field of optics, its main functions are as follows: 2.1 The selection of HV and HK scale; 2.2 Automatically switched between the indenter and the objective; 2.3 Inputting by means of the touch keys on the operating board, presetting of the dwell time for test force, regulation of the intensity for measuring light source; 2.4 After keying in the diagonal line length of indentation through soft keys, the hardness value will be automatically shown on the screen. 3. According to the particular requirements of the client, the instrument can be equipped with CCD device. The instrument is suitable for testing the micro and thin pieces, the parts with the permeated and coated surface, it is also fit for testing Vickers and Knoop hardness value for the crisp materials such as the agate, glass, ceramics and it is, therefore, an ideal hardness measuring instrument for the scientific research institutes, the universities and colleges, the industrial production units and the metrological institutes using with for studying and measuring.
