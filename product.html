<h1>HST-ZXQ5TY Hydraulic Auto Specimen Mounting Machine</h1><div><p> Introduction: HST-ZXQ5TY automatic Metallographic specimen mounting pressis a kind of full automatic mounting press, equipped with in-out water cooling system. It is suitable for the heat mounting (thermohardening &amp; thermoplastic) for all kinds of materials. After the parameters such as heating temperature, heat preserving time and applied force etc. are set up, put the specimen and mounting material into the machine, close the cover and press the start button, then the machine will finish the job automatically.  It is not necessary for the operator to be on duty. According to different requirements of the material, there are four kinds of moulds that can be chosen to meet the demands at will. Technical specifications: Diameter of specimen: Ø25mm, Ø30mm, Ø40mm, Ø50mm Power supply: single phase, 220V, 50Hz Max. power consumption: 1650W Temperature setting range: 200 Heat preserving time: 1 to 99 min </p></div>
