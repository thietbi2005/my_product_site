<h1>HST- MoPao4ST Automatic Metallographic Specimen Grinding And Polishing Machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> HST-MoPao4ST automatic grinding and polishing machine is a double-disc desktop machine. It is a new generation of high-precision grinding and polishing equipment with automatic sample preparation process, which is manufactured according to international standards and adopts international advanced technology. It has the functions of optional rotation direction of grinding and polishing disk, quick replacement of grinding and polishing disk, multi-sample holder and pneumatic single-point loading. This machine adopts an advanced microprocessor control system, which makes the rotation speed of the grinding and polishing disc and the grinding and polishing head infinitely adjustable, and the setting of sample preparation pressure and time is intuitive and convenient. Only need to replace the grinding and polishing disc or sandpaper and fabric to complete the grinding and polishing process. So that the machine shows a wider range of applications. It has the characteristics of stable rotation, safety and reliability, low noise and the use of cast aluminum base to increase the rigidity of grinding and polishing. </p><p> Parameter: MODEL：HST-MoPao4ST Load Type ：Pneumatic single point and central force loading Structure ：Dual disk and dual control Grinding and polishing disk diameter ：φ250mm φ203 or φ300mm (optional) Disk speed ：50~1000rpm(stepless) 400, 600,800,1000rpm(fixed speed) Rotational direction Clockwise or anticlockwise Power head speed 5-150 r/min Sample preparation time 0-3000S Preparation sample quantity 6 PCS Sample diameter ：φ30mm(φ22-φ45 optional) Lighting ：LED Air pressure ：0-0.7MPa Motor power ：900W Power supply ：Single-phase 220V,50Hz Dimensions ：755×815×690 mm Weight ：120kg Power supply: 220V, 1-Phase, 50Hz </p></div>
