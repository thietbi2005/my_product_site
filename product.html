<h1>501M Research Type Upright Metallographic Micro</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p>: The research-grade trinocular upright Metallographic Microscope integrates a number of firsts. From appearance to performance, it closely follows the international leading design trend, and is committed to expanding a new pattern in the industrial field. It can provide various observation functions such as reflection bright field, reflection dark field, transmission bright field, transmission and reflection polarized light, reflection differential interference and so on. Technical Data: The machine model：501M optical system:Infinite far chromatic difference correction optical system observing tube:30° tilt, just like, infinite distance hinge three-way observation tube, pupil distance adjustment: 50mm~76mm, two-gear light separation ratio binocular: three eyes =100:0 or 0:100 Bright and dark field:Half again achromatic objective: LMPLFL  5X /0.15 BD DIC WD 13.5mm LMPLFL10X/0.30 BD DIC WD 9.0mm LMPLFL20X/0.5 BD DIC WD 2.5mm LMPLFL50X/0.80 BD WD 1.0mm </p></div>
