<h1>Vacuum Optical Emission Spectrometer For Metal Analysis</h1><div><p> HST-W5 Optical Emission Spectrometer bring in the advanced technology from Europe. It is the 4th generation Arc/Spark-OES with high performance lowing operating cost for metal analysis and this is the laTest research and development of detection equipment. The overall optical design has been enhanced, and with improvements of CMOS technology used to further improve the performance of the W5 while retaining the major benefit of earlier units. The CMOS spectrometer is not only contain the full spectrum characteristics of CCD spectrometer but also the extremely low detection limit for non-metallic elements such as C, S, P, B, As, N etc. The operation is simple and easy to learn. The test result is stable and accuracy. It is a good choice of all common metals for incoming and outgoing product quality control. </p><p> HST-W5 optical emission spectrometer (spark OES) is used for applications in metal elemental analysis, trace element analysis for science and industry like Metallurgy, Foundry, Mechanical Engineering, Scientific Research, Product Inspection, Automobile, Petrochemical Engineering, Shipbuilding, Electrics, Aerospace, Nuclear Power, Metallic and Nonferrous Metallic Smelting, Processing and Recycling. </p><p> Steel Plants Where needs high accuracy or elements like C, N, Cr, S, P etc. </p><p> Testing Laboratories: Commercial testing laboratories, Universities and colleges </p><p> Pure metal applications purity Al, Pb, Zn, Cu etc. – most industrial users </p><p> Regulatory compliance Very low LODs to control Pb, Cd, As etc. </p><p> Foundries which need a quick analysis near the furnace </p><p> Manufacturing Facilities </p><p> Warehouse material identification </p><p> Base: Fe, Cu, Al, Ni, Co, Mg, Ti, Zn, Pb, Sn, Ag, Mn, Cr etc </p></div>
