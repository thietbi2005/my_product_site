<h1>WSW-100 Biaxial tensile testing machine</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> The biaxial tensile Testing machine takes electronic servo control technology as the core, and can carry out two-way tensile Tests of various metallic and non-metallic materials. The main technical units of the system include: a host, accessories, wire and cable, a set of necessary tools and technical information. The main frame is made of integral steel plate, which is beautiful and durable. The bidirectional spiral precision ball screw pair is used to ensure that the center of the sample does not change during bidirectional stretching. The attachment can be configured according to user requirements, and the wedge-shaped extension attachment can be selected for the tensile test. The fixture can be customized according to user samples 2.
