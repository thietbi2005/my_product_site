<h1>HST-2000W Trinocular Inverted Metallurgical Microscope</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p> Used to identify and analyze composite structures of all kinds of metal and alloy material. Widely used in factory or lab for casting quality appraisal. The inspection of raw materials or microstructure analysis after material handling. And do some research work of surface phenomenon. It’s the Metallographic analysis of iron and steel, non-ferrous metal materials, casting, coating; petrographic analysis of geology; An effective means for industrial fields to microcosmic research compounds, ceramics, etcs. It’s the necessary instrument of metallography organization structure and material science research materials. Also widely used in biology, medicine and education, etc. A growing body of research has not meet the conventional way of metallographic Microscope and camera, input the microscopic imaging into microcomputer, make all kinds of image post-processing by microprocessor, is new technology in the field of microsurgery synchronous in today's world. Metallographic microscope, access the high resolution CCD camera system, process, edit, save and output (such as print, etc.) the images by computer or enter the multimedia system and E-mail address. If further access to the image analysis computer operating system, further research and analysis on the metallographic atlas, or image precision measurement, multi-function image morphological analysis, statistics and output the report. 2. Function Using professional optical lens and flat field eyepiece, good image quality, high resolution, observe comfortable. Offers superior image quality and reliable mechanical structure. Optional corresponding photographic camera accessories, to collect and save the Observed images, with computers and professional metallurgical analysis software to analysis the images. Easy operation, complete accessories, widely used in metallographic analysis for teaching and scientific research, semiconductor silicon wafer Testing, address mineral analysis, precision engineering measurement, etc. 3. Specifications 1.
