<h1>ZXQ-2 Metallographic Sample Mounting Presses</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p>: Automatic Metallographic Sample Mounting Press is used to mosaic small specimens, specimens in irregular shapes, or specimens which are not easy to take up-the preceding process before grinding and polishing metallographic or rock specimens. The mosaic operation serves to facilitate the grinding and polishing operations of the specimens and the routine observation of the composition of the material under the metallographic microscope. The machine is heated, and intensified with pressure automatically. After the formation of the specimen under pressure, it stops the operation and discharges the pressure also in an automatical way. With another press of the knob, the machine automatically turns up the specimen, which may be taken away. Note: It is only for the hot solid materials (such as urea-formaldehyde molding powder and bakelite powder) with the temperature automatically regulated and controlled. </p> <h3> Main specification </h3> <table><tbody><tr><td> Model </td><td></td><td> ZXQ-2 </td></tr><tr><td> Diameter of specimen </td><td> φ22mm, φ30mm, φ45mm </td></tr><tr><td> Cooling method </td><td></td><td> water cooling </td></tr><tr><td> Heater </td><td> 220V 650W </td></tr><tr><td> Electric Power </td><td> 1000W </td></tr><tr><td> Power supply </td><td> single phase, 220V, 50Hz </td></tr></tbody></table></div>
