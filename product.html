<h1>HST-MoPao2D Metallographic Grinding Polish Machine</h1><div><p> 1. Introduction: HST-MoPao2D dual-speed Metallographic specimen grinding and polishing machine is equipped with double discs and features two level constant speeds for grinding and polishing, including 300rpm and 600rpm. It can finish the whole process of rough grinding, fine grinding, rough polishing and finishing polishing for specimen preparing. The machine has a cooling device to cool the sample during pre-grinding, thus preventing the damage of the metallographic structure caused by overheat of the sample. It is the necessary metallographic specimen preparing instrument in factories, scientific research institutes and laboratories of colleges. 2. Technical Specifications: Power supply: 380V, 50Hz Working style: Double discs with double control Diameter of working disc: 203 mm Grinding Disc Rotating Speed: 300 rpm and 600 rpm Motor power: 120W/250W*2 </p></div>
