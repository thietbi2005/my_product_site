<h1>HST-L600 600KN Insulator Electromechanical Test Machine</h1><div><p> Introduction: HST-L series insulator testing machine is suitable for simultaneous mechanical load and high voltage Testing of porcelain insulators, glass insulators and suspension insulators. Based on the mechanical and electrical joint Test standards and combined with actual operations, the difficulty of automatically conducting mechanical tests under the application of high voltage electricity was solved. Through the optimization of circuits and controls, automatic mechanical tests under 100KV high voltage were successfully completed (the highest voltage currently commonly used is 70KV), and High voltage and mechanical control are controlled on the same console. After setting the force value parameters and voltage parameters in the program, the mechanical load and voltage are automatically applied. Manual intervention is no longer required. The voltage parameters and mechanical parameters are displayed on the same program interface. The device will It is combined with mechanical control instead of being separated into two separate devices. Parameters: 1. Maximum test force: 600kN (60 tons) 2. Test force measurement range and accuracy: 10-600kN, test force accuracy: better than ±1% (equivalent to 4 levels) 3. Displacement measurement range and accuracy: 300mm; ±0.5% 4. Maximum distance between stretching jaws (excluding piston stroke and clamp): 1100mm 5. Upper and lower pressure plate size: 204x204mm 6. Effective test space (distance) between left and right columns: not less than 830mm 7. Maximum piston stroke: 300mm 8. Stretching speed: 0-100mm/min 9. Microcomputer controlled tensile load rate: 15kN/min-600kN/min </p></div>
