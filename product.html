<h1>HST Direct Reading OES Spectrometer Used In Foundry</h1><div><p> HST-W4 Spectrometer is most suitable instrument for the determination of various elements in different matrices (Fe, Cu, Al, Ni, Co, Mg, Ti, Zn, Pb, Sn, Ag, etc ). It is an economical and easy solution to quick analysis near the furnace, metal processing quality control and incoming material inspection, research laboratories and metal grade identification </p><p> This also gives the user a truly economical spectrometer that’s both easy to use and easy to space saved. The optical system uses a CMOS detector with a spectral range covering all typical materials. It can accurately and reliably analyze from low-level elements to high-content elements. The compact structure design allows users to combine production and quality control more closely </p><p> Steel plants where needs are at around 100 PPM levels or elements like C, Cr, S, P etc. </p><p> Rolling mills, foundries, workshops: Rapid analysis; Test several 100s of samples daily </p><p> Alloy manufacturers: Any number of bases / matrices; highly stable and precise </p><p> Testing Laboratories: Commercial testing laboratories, Universities and colleges </p><p> Medium-sized industries: Extremely rugged and economical; low cost / analysis </p><p> Foundries which need a quick analysis near the furnace </p><p> Warehouse material identification </p><p> Base: Fe, Cu, Al, Ni, Co, Mg, Ti, Zn, Pb, Sn, Ag, etc </p></div>
