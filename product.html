<h1>HST- EIT60 Rubber Rebound Resilience Elasticity Impact Tester</h1><div><p><h3> Application </h3> Rebound Resilience Elasticity tester is used for determining the rebound resilience of rubber the hardness of which lies between 30IRHD~85IRHD. The resilience elasticity is defined as the ratio of the regained energy in relation to the applied energy. This ratio of energy corresponds with the quotient of the height of the resilience and the height of the drop of the pendulum. It completely conforms to. To meet the standards: In line with GB / T 1681 "Determination of vulcanized rubber elasticity" and the requirements of ISO4662 standards. <p> Technical parameter: </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p> Instruction Range </p></td><td><p> 0~100% </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Marking scale </p></td><td><p> 1% </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Adjustable range of specimen thickness </p></td><td><p> 0~60mm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Scale mark </p></td><td><p> 1mm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Measuring elastic feeding device Test </p></td><td><p> Flexible test material measuring device (in line with DIN53512 and ISO4662 specifications) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Dimension </p></td><td><p> 62*12*33cm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Weight </p></td><td><p> 38k </p></td></tr></tbody></table></p></div>
