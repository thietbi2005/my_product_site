<h1>HST-VM3 Vacuum Mounting Press</h1><div><h3> Application </h3> <p>: HST-VM3 Vacuum Mounting Machine is a special equipment for cold mounting of samples. The sample and mounting resin can be degassed by evacuating the sample and mounting resin. In this way, the voids in the sample will be filled with the mounting resin, and there will be no gaps between the sample and the mounting resin. The device is compact, fast and easy to use. 10 samples with a diameter of 30mm can be mounted at the same time. 2.
