<h1>GOST 7912-74 Rubber Plastic Cables Low Temperature Brittleness Tester</h1><div> Introduction: Rubber low temperature brittleness tester is to determine the maximum temperature under the impact of the rubber specimen, that is brittle temperature, also for performance comparation of non-hard plastic and other elastic materials in the low temperature conditions. Can also be measured to Test the brittle temperature and low temperature performance in different rubber materials or different formulations of vulcanized rubber. In line with ISO 812 ISO 974 ASTM D2137, GB / T 1682-82, GB / T 15256-94 test method. <h3>Technique paramaters: </h3><ul><li> Test temperature: -60℃—0℃</li><li> Impact speed: 2m/s±0.2m/s</li><li> After constant temperature, the temperature fluctuation within 3 minutes of the test: &lt;±0.5℃</li><li> Distance from impactor center to lower end of gripper: 11±0.5mm (rubber) 3.6±0.1mm (plastic)</li><li> Dimensions: 720×700×1300mm</li><li> Power: 1100w</li><li> Cold well volume: 700ml</li><li> Power supply: three-phase</li></ul></div>
