<h1>HST-MoPao4T Metallographic Specimen Grinding and Polishing Machine</h1><div><p> The HST-MoPao4T automatic grinding and polishing machine is a single table grinding and polishing machine. According to international standards and using international advanced technology, a new type of grinding and polishing equipment with single-point force is developed and manufactured. (No electronic proportional valve, manual pressure regulation)             </p><p> The rotation direction of the grinding and polishing disk can be selected arbitrarily, and the grinding and polishing disk can be quickly replaced; it has a multi-sample clamp and a specific pneumatic single-point loading function. This machine adopts an advanced microprocessor control system, which makes the rotation speed of the grinding and polishing disc and grinding and polishing head infinitely adjustable, and the sample preparation pressure and time settings are intuitive and convenient. Just replace the grinding and polishing disc or sandpaper and fabric to complete the grinding and polishing process. This enables the machine to exhibit a wider range of applicability. It has the characteristics of stable rotation, safety and reliability, low noise and the use of cast aluminum base to increase the rigidity of grinding and polishing. </p><p> The automatic locking function of the electromagnetic lock of the grinding head of this machine is safe and convenient. Equipped with a water cooling device, the sample can be cooled during grinding to prevent damage to the Metallographic structure due to overheating of the sample and to flush away the abrasive particles at any time; coupled with a fiberglass shell and stainless steel standard parts, the appearance is more beautiful. It is beautiful and elegant, and has improved anti-corrosion and anti-rust properties and is easy to clean. </p><p> It is suitable for automatic sample preparation of metallographic samples from rough grinding, fine grinding, rough polishing to fine polishing. It is an ideal sample preparation equipment for enterprises, scientific research institutions and laboratories of universities and colleges. </p><table><tbody><tr><td><p> Model </p></td><td><p> HST-MoPao4T </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Grinding Disc Diameter </p></td><td><p> φ250mm (φ230mm, φ300mm can be customized) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Grinding and polishing disc speed </p></td><td><p>  50-1000 r/min (stepless speed regulation) and 300/600/900 r/min (3-level fixed speed) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Grinding and polishing disc steering </p></td><td><p> adjustable forward and reverse selection </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Grinding and polishing head speed </p></td><td><p> 5-150 r/min (stepless speed regulation) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Number of prepared samples </p></td><td><p> 4 pcs </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Input air source </p></td><td><p> 0.4-0.7Mpa </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Loading range </p></td><td><p> 0-0.7Mpa adjustable </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Sample preparation time </p></td><td><p> 0-3000S </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Sample diameter </p></td><td><p> Factory standard φ30mm (can be customized with diameters φ22-φ45mm) </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Dimensions </p></td><td><p> 550*760*640mm </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> net weight </p></td><td><p> 60kg </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> Input power </p></td><td><p> 1.1KW </p></td></tr><tr><td><p> power supply </p></td><td><p> Single phase 220V, 50HZ </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
